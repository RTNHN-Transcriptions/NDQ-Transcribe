Seems like you're always going places for work. When I first met you, the way you traveled really confused me. What do you mean? Well, I didn't travel much for work at all back then. I mean, I had the occasional trip to go and do a church thing or, you know, to go do a learning thing like a three-day seminar or something. I didn't travel much for my job. You were traveling all the time for your job. You'd tell me where you were going. You're like, I'm going to Houston. I'm like, oh, dude, there's this thing in Houston and there's this other thing in Houston. How long are you going to be there? And you just look at me like I was an idiot and your answer would always be, you're not understanding. I'm going to be there for the least amount of time possible. And I don't think it's because you hate Houston or whatever cities you were going to. I have my theory, I guess, as to why you were in and out so quick. But maybe instead of saying my theory, I'll just ask you, why do you always get in and out of places so dang fast when you pay the money to be there anyway? Um, first of all, I'm not even self-aware that I do that. I guess it's because I want to be home with the family. Okay. So I just go to the place, do the thing even better if I can like tack on two or three things. Like I can think of videos where I've gone to a place for a thing and I just shot two other videos that were within 50 miles. Yeah. So I try to do that kind of thing a lot. Family is the thing. I like to sleep in my own bed. And I like to be around my kids. And yeah, that's why I do that. And that would have been my guess more or less, but you are ruthlessly efficient with your travel. You do not leave yourself a lot of wiggle room in between. Again, I don't know if you know this about yourself, but when I'm like, Oh, tell me more. What are you going to do? You're in New York. Cool. You're making a video. Well, you know, what are you going to do? And you will reel off your itinerary. And you're like from 757 a.m. until 1045. I'll be filming this interview. And I will be going to this thing. Then I'll have 10 minutes to quick film a horse that's standing on one leg in this museum that I've always wanted to see. And then I will quickly be going to this thing. Then I'm going to do a second video from two in the afternoon to 430. And then my flight is at 431. Yeah. Recently, I did that in. I went to Idaho and I went from Idaho to LA and yeah, I did exactly that. It's ruthless. You're on flights a lot. But I don't know. Do you have fun? I was going to say it doesn't seem like you're having any fun, but maybe you should get to speak to that. Yeah. Well, I appreciate you telling me about this because I didn't realize this about myself, but there's no criticism. Well, it's different. So I'm not traveling for pleasure. I'm traveling for work. But at the same time, it may be a thing I really wanted to see. And then there's targets of opportunity along the way because recently I did a video about metal forming this new thing called Roboforming. I had a two hour block and I heard about this thing and I called them. I was like, can I come do the thing? Or maybe the guy emailed me or I forget. But it's like, hey, I'm going to LA. Let me put up the spreadsheet because I have a spreadsheet. People will contact stuff, you know, smarter every day, say, Hey, would you like to come see our thing? And I organize it by city. And if I'm going to the city, I will look at the spreadsheet and be like, Oh, I have this much time. There's a thing there. I can go do that thing. And so I try to maximize the efficiency. What do you do when you travel? Well, when it's for work, I do the same thing. I try to maximize for efficiency, but not as hard as you. So I did a series of videos in St. Augustine that I filmed about a year ago as we're talking right now. And I left myself a lot of wiggle room to look at plants and fish and to sit super long meals on a rooftop, St. Augustine and watch the people go by. And I guess, thank the hots. I like the I like this or time. I want to feel the place a little bit, you know, I want to, you know, this about me, you know, that I feel like I sort of have a place in my hip pocket as soon as I have a mental map of it. The street goes here. That cathedral is right there. Yeah. And there's that cool park right across the way. It's important to me for whatever reason is kind of how I organize a big part of my invisible life, the life of the mind for me is very place oriented. It's very geography and map oriented as well. I know this about you. Yeah, that's true fish tennis church. Like those are all things that I care about when I travel. And so if I didn't line the right things up and I get to a town, I'm like, I'm going to go interview these people who are doing a religious thing that's nothing like what I do or what I'm into, but I just want to know. So I'm going to their house of faith or whatever. And then I see a really cool one while I'm driving in that I didn't catch in my research. I feel huge regret. Oh, I could be getting that as well. So sometimes real creepy. Like I'll just go into churches where I didn't call them in advance and just kind of mill around and seem friendly. And I just hope somebody's going to come up and be like, so what? He's just looking at the church. I'm like, yeah, I like looking at churches. I mean, I sometimes I make videos about churches. I like to learn about other people's churches. And my fantasy is that someday somebody's going to be like, well, let's just do it right now. What do you want to know? Do you have a microphone? I mean, go, I couldn't possibly I insist. Okay. I'm going to flute out of your out of your sleeve like an anchor man. Yeah, exactly. I couldn't possibly I'm not too well. I'm not a bad girl. It was jazz flute ready to go. Yeah, I go real hard on my travel as well. And I leave a lot of room in between, but it never seems to help me because what I do requires advanced planning and all of that. But you're just a ruthless advanced planner. You're getting so much. What I have noticed though, is that I think I travel for pleasure more than you. I am more likely to put the family in the vehicle and take a week off and drive somewhere that makes no sense. Whereas you're more likely to put the family in the vehicle and do 36 hours of super intense adventuring dad ventures, I believe you call them or work travel. Those seem to be the two things. I mean, I don't know. It just seems like you haven't had the time for the pure pleasure travel stuff that maybe some other folks prioritize. I don't know. I just kind of wonder like, do you feel like you're missing out on stuff or there are places that you want to go see that you haven't had the opportunity to yet? Yeah, there are. And one of those places forever was Italy. And you convinced me to do that. I don't know if convinced is the right word. You weren't like, you should do this. I don't stand in there, man. But I mean, it was our 20th anniversary and Tara and I decided we were going to go somewhere for us just to, for the marriage. Did you do anything for work? Yeah. I mean, I recorded some stuff. I took a camera because I was like, you know, if I don't take a camera and I see the most amazing thing ever and I don't record it, I will always regret that. Yeah. I took pictures for me. You took some orders along the way. Just a couple. Hey, dude, I'm working on a thing. Where are you at right now? There should be a sculpture of a guy with wings and he's by a sign. Could you take it at like six in the evening from this angle, please? Thank you. You know, that was my contribution to your trip. Work orders the whole way. It was a unique thing because we, like you said, we don't do that. We don't travel for pleasure. We usually have a thing we're doing. All I've got is road trip to see us. I've got Iceland for an anniversary trip with your wife. Last significant anniversary ago. And then your most recent significant anniversary, you went to Italy. I've known you for a long time. Yeah. I've been in the field that those are the only big ones that I can really think of. I think that's it. We did a, I think it was like four days in Costa Rica, a language school. Yeah, but that was practical. You were doing something. You were gaining a skill. Yeah. But I think that's it. I think that's it. I think it's because, I don't know if this sounds stupid even say it. I'm nervous even talking about this. Feels guilty? Like I feel guilty for taking time off and doing, I don't know, time off is the thing, but like I'm going to go do this thing. I don't know. That feels strange. That feels strange. Does travel make you feel refreshed when you do it for fun? Yeah. Why don't you do it more? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. That's a good idea. Did your Italy trip make you feel refreshed when you were done? I was tired because we walked a lot, but yeah. I'd say mentally refreshed because it exposed us. So what are my favorite things to do in my entire life is be in a place with my wife? I mean, like it's like me and Tara versus the thing and we don't speak the language. You know what I'm saying? I do. What about you? Yeah. Same thing. I would use a little different illustration. You went with combat. I'm going to go with Christmas. But I mean, for us, it's like unwrapping the present. I can only unwrap the present of each place once. And so before I go, I try to read a whole bunch of history and literature about a place familiarized myself with art and poetry and who these people are and where do they come from? And how do they think of themselves? And what is the oldest historical through line that I can trace that I understand the story of from a given place I'm visiting back to things I know on the history family tree? I like to know that stuff. But I can have the antenna out for connections. And then my favorite thing to do is get dropped in a city for the first part of the trip and figure it out. No idea. Just solve it. Well, one thing I know about you is that when we first started talking, you were talking about ancient Rome and you were talking about the history of thought in the West, I think, is the way you said it. Is that right? Yeah. I like that. So I think it's about a lot of things and you had told me about going to Rome and why it was important to you and you had told me about wanting to go back and look at certain things. Like I can remember you, you made a video where Paul was in prison. Yeah. And you were explaining all that to me. You're telling me why this specific spot is interesting. You said, well, you know, the Catholic church says this happened there. We don't really know, but then this is tradition says, and you were telling me all those things and I thought it was fascinating. I don't know when it came time to hey, we're gonna go to a place hearing you pun intended romanticize all of this for so Long I was like man. I've got to see that yeah You just tapped into the word that I have in mind and then I kind of wanted to pick your brain about knowing that you went on This trip for me the romantic joy of going to a place with Camilla is I just like seeing her in a different culture. I like seeing her quite literally in a different light Every town every great city is lit different it feels different and almost like the little imperceptible details of people You know real well are a little bit different as they adapt to that over the course of a couple days in terms of climate and culture and everything I mean I've never seen Camilla against the backdrop of Prague and I really want to take her there I've had the opportunity to go to Prague for work things on my own. I don't want to unwrap the present without her because Then if we go it's asymmetrical now I'm the knower and I'm introducing her to a thing as though I have ownership of it I'm an ownership of Prague because I go once and I still haven't gone I Want whatever ownership I have I want to be shared completely equally with her And I want to earn that ownership not by going and ticking the boxes of the tourist destinations you're supposed to see I Want to earn it by getting lost and taking risks and getting into weird corners of things and going to the places that aren't even Really that interesting and that don't make the tourist guides But that have some obscure connection to some goofy little thing that only I care about from forever ago I think she thrives on seeing me get excited about that stuff and I thrive on her savoring the beauty of things and The carefree spirit that she has when we travel it's a pretty carefree lady But there's a lot of burdens to raising three kids and keeping track of all the dumb stuff. I'm doing She's so light in the shoulders when I take her places there's an elegance and a youthfulness and a lightness that traveling together and unwrapping the present together brings out of her and to me That is the pinnacle of romance for us New brush stuff that is rooted in old things. We have an encounter. Yeah, we love that what I don't get it what I was thinking about romance and the pinnacle of romance and Why I'm sorry, I'm sorry the day-to-day marriage stuff I saw something online and I was like I'm gonna try this It's so the other day There's a guy is like hey honey come in here. There's an exposed stud in here Talking about you know like yes, well, I know I can see where I get it So tarot comes around the corner. She's like So maybe I need to work on the romance That's seriously your follow-up story this heartfelt crap about unwrapping the mysteries of the old world together No connecting with our ancient roots. Well check it out by a man. Hey, yo, it's like this streak Yeah, you raise Stevens. Yes, no, there's something about breaking free of the day-to-day like the everyday Monotony of feeling like ships in the night passing all said we did something with this trip to Italy That was very rare. We said how many days should we go? And so we called in all the favors all the not babysitting favors You know our parents are awesome and they love their grandchildren But we just said hey, we're gonna do this Will you help us? They're like, yeah, of course We went for 14 days, which was nuts impressive. I think it was 14 did that fuel maybe it was 10 Maybe you did that make you feel nervous and apprehensive because you're used to traveling for 11 hours When you take flights to go places and then coming straight back a thousand percent. Yeah, the open-endedness was weird Yeah, yeah, the open-endedness was weird the financial investment was I mean It was just something we had prepared for for a really long time Yeah, and so it was that was nerve-wracking with you I know you make a decision like this is a big part of your finances for your life is Making these investments on the experience tool with your your family. Yes this is valuable to you and you choose to live in a smaller house so you can do more of these types of things and I don't know that I like the way that sounded but you know what I'm trying to say. It's true. No You live modestly we prioritize this I have strategic reasons parenting wise Also, it keeps my brain from getting stale. I want to see the things I talk about from the past I want to feel the things I talk about so you've told me all about Rome You can only imagine the amount of prep I did going in so I I listened to Rubicon by Tom Holland great book You put me on a Persian fire So I feel like I had this whole experience of learning about Persia how that morphs into Greek power and then Greek You know kind of transforms the Romans the rise the Romans and so I'm trying to understand all this And so I go to Rome. We ended our trip in Rome And I was like man. I want to see where Julius Caesar was killed Like I want to see that. I mean that was a big you know YouTube Brutus. I mean it's a big deal. Yeah If you feel you found it do I understand correctly that it is a like a cat pound Like it's a place for abandoned cats now. Do I understand that? Yeah, it's a pretty quirky spot tucked in the middle of all of the theater Pompeii is that what it was called? Mm-hmm It's just that that's where stray cats are now Yes, I mean there are stray cats everywhere, but okay, I have a question for you about the forum But before I go there to me it sounds like the first objective of your Italy trip Was romance it just yeah go somewhere beautiful and romantic and different and savor being with somebody you love fair statement Absolutely that was the point and it could have been anywhere on the planet That was what we wanted to do We wanted to go somewhere where we were Uncomfortable and we found comfort in each other and then we also tried to navigate Something that we didn't know how to do together that was the point so if you could have gone anywhere Why was Italy a good fit for drawing those things out because we didn't speak the language and I can navigate in Spanish. I don't I wouldn't say I speak Spanish, but I can do it really well I can get by yeah Germany we've done that Tara's mother grew up speaking German and her grandmother did you're fairly handy on the basics of German as well There's not much there. Thank you for the compliment, but I can I told you about the time I called the young man handicapped on the train. Do you just take the compliment and move on? But Italy it's just different we just wanted to see what the culture was plus We like Italian food as we understood it to be from the American perspective. It sounds like maybe you learned lessons about maybe maybe okay Okay, so you plan a very unusual trip. I do not know you to take these kind of trips Clearly you put a ton of thought into it. I mean Tara was asking questions about Italy a year in advance of this trip Maybe was it that far? Yeah, I mean yeah Selling her on the idea with of Italy was hard because we had thought about other places But when we shifted to Italy it was a hard time in our lives we were trying to just logistically we've had a lot going on and so the idea of Breaking free from the day-to-day and doing this was difficult for both of us. Yeah, it was hard But once she decided he's like we're in once she made that decision We got the Bible which is the Rick Steves travel book for Italy Yeah, and then you know about Rick Steves I do he's amazing And so once we got that it was on like Donkey Kong man We're like we're gonna figure this out It was gonna be great and it was it was awesome where I want to end up here is I I mean just know this question is coming I Want your opinion on what somebody should look for if they want to do the romantic trip of a lifetime Okay, I'm very interested in what you learned about breaking free from all the normal stuff and going and doing something that you love with Someone you love but also I really like Italy and I want to pick a brain about that Did you go to Rome at the beginning your trip or at the end we ended in Rome we started in Venice and Then we if I'm looking at the boot. Yeah with the toe facing to the left We started at the top right of the boot. Okay, like as you pull it up on your leg That's where Venice is right. Mm-hmm. And then we crossed the top of the boot And then we went to the other side. I think Pisa Milan. Yeah, no no we didn't go to Milan We did briefly go to Pisa like for two hours. Okay. We drove across Tuscany and Then we went to Florence is Florence and Tuscany So northern This is what I would say the Tuscany Umbria Lazio is north to south from Florence down to Rome. I think see I recognize all those words. I would say The purpose of the trip was familiarization not mastery That's a that's a phrase we said recently we took the kids to Washington DC for their like hey Let's talk about our government trip. Mm-hmm in Tara said hey the point here is familiarization not mastery We did that and so I don't really have a good vibe for everything in Italy. You don't have the mental map yet I don't okay not of the whole nation in fact. We didn't even get to the southern coast I don't think so never been to the southern coast. We started in Venice which I loved and then we went over to Florence That's right. So we went over to Florence and then I don't know where we went from there I do know I drove across Tuscany. Did you go to Sienna? Yes, you did yes, that's the walled city. It's Awesome the coolest town we spent I mean is that is that top 10 for you coolest towns you've ever been to yes Yeah, no doubt decisively so so they have this thing in Sienna correct me if I'm wrong because you're the authority They have this thing called Paolo that sounds right. This is the horse thing dude So being from Alabama we have Alabama versus Auburn which I think is a very significant rivalry Maybe Ohio State Michigan is up there as well your in-state rivalry Effects relationships and how people talk with each other yeah in this state It's it pushes right to the limit your southern hospitality and charm So Sienna is a walled city And each section of the city has its own team so to speak You have like this horse that you root for and they have a horse race in the center of the city They bring in all this sand and it's not a square. It's like a weird dodeca gone shape It's weird they have this horse race around the center of the city for like four minutes Or maybe it's less it that's the whole thing that's the whole thing, but like they I think they have two of them a year If I'm not mistaken were you there for one no I wish God that would be awesome But we chose teams when we were there. Oh, who do you root for the goose the one with the there's a flag And it has a goose on it and I used to know the name of it. I hate the goose one I'm with team wolf. I like the wolf one really I think Tara was going for the shell one But do you know if there's a wolf one I just was I think whatever you said I was gonna hate your team Yes, that's what it was Your team could have been like there's one with a drawing of a guy It looks just like you and I still would have hated it. Oh exactly. Yeah, okay They all have these teams that they root for and it's just awesome It's just so and they care and it matters and they said in Sienna you're born and Then Paolo and then you die That's how they say it so like that's really all that matters. There's not life. There's Paolo Do you see the quantum of solace the James Bond movie? No, it's not good It's maybe the second Daniel Craig James Bond movie, okay, but it opens during if it's called this Paolo Yeah, I don't remember the name. I'm going off what you said, but it opens with that going on in the background And then there's a spy versus spy combat running across Hericata roofs and shooting guns They're the famous ending of that chase sequence is in a church bell tower. That's under construction And like the lines are taking them up and down and they're doing like this weightless Shoot at each other as one goes up and one goes down kind of thing and ultimately bond gets Wrapped up around the waist in one and let's himself roll down like an unfurling scroll and then freezes Three feet before he lands in the bottom and bang Shoots the other spy. Yeah, obviously is a spy you train for that sort of thing. Yeah, that's really perfectly morbid. No in the What do you call what do you call big churches in Italy? They have a name Duomo? Okay in the Duomo in Sienna it was a big deal. I was told They were uncovering the floor for the first time in a really really long time. What were they looking for? Well, it was there were mosaics They had restored some of the mosaics the mosaics on the floor in Sienna or some of the most intricate designs out of tile and stone in all of Italy. It was a big deal. They're like hey You got here at the right time because you can go to the Duomo and you can see the floor. I'm like, okay, whatever whatever That sounds great. Okay. We'll go see it. We went dude. I'm not Catholic and so I don't get into some of the It feels like sometimes people are praying to statues and stuff for like light and candles and stuff I don't do all that I mean, that's not a terrible characterization the Protestants have more of a belief that people die and then they are present with the Lord and Not exactly accessible when somebody's dead So if you run into just a random American Christian that'll tend to be how they think about dead Christians will be reunited later So for example, my kid brother Christian is dead. I don't Theologically believe myself to have any kind of access to him through a media area or anything like that I mean it still hasn't stopped me a couple times in moments of grief from being like Hey, I don't know if you pass along messages or whatever But if the Catholics are right on that one like you just hate on my brother whatever's I think time works probably different there But yeah miss him today. I don't know just miss him miss my kid brother Don't have another one So if you don't relay messages cool because of how you're like the divine sustainer of all of existence and everything And I'm sure you're planning and reasoning for not doing like message relays is a super good one So that's fine. Did you ask to like pass along a nuggy or something like that? No, but like a couple jokes that I thought were pretty funny and that were maybe right on the edge for God to hear so like No, I probably knew what you my understanding is that the all-knowing creator and sustainer of all things is pretty aware of all the jokes So I just figured I couldn't offend him. I'll try I don't know I think I think if you're Catholic you're allowed to do that so at any rate the Catholics and the Orthodox have more of an understanding of Like everybody being alive at the same time Or something that transcends time a little bit more and so the role of the saints is very different Whereas a Protestant would be like I really respect all of these people from the history of the Bible and the church That was a really honorable person the Catholics and Orthodox have more of a structure and a criteria for that and in Orthodoxy the Eastern version of the church associated with Greece and modern-day Turkey and really all of Eastern Europe and The idea is that that person can be represented drawn as an icon and Somehow that is a point of communion with that person. I'm not Orthodox. I'm not saying it right. It's a mystery Catholics don't do the icons the same way but representations of saints statues and things like that I mean all of these different groups they say the same creeds Like I believe in god the father stuff that you probably say in church These are ancient words that are the boundaries of Christian faith But one of the real differences between these groups and it can be very disorienting when you travel in Italy If you haven't around this much is their understanding of our relationship with the dead and what the timeline looks like on that And so for the Catholics The dead are a little bit closer and for the Orthodox the dead are a lot closer And for the Protestants, it's more of a wait a little while and we'll be back together and I think yeah And so the art it just hits different it feels different And I assume that's what you were referencing when you were talking about not being a Catholic and the stuff that you were seeing there Yeah, exactly. Thanks for protecting me for myself there Sorry, no absolutely so so the the spiritual connection with the rooms and the art in the room Maybe doesn't hit it's hard for me. However, some of the things on the floor in siena the mosaics Really stirred my soul. What was different about them? Um It was just unapologetically gruesome. I know that sounds crazy, but it doesn't keep going so so like uh In the bible, there's this messiah that's been born this king, right? And he's he's over here in this little town bedside him or something like that. Yeah, and then there's this dude. He's like hey Um, so there's this a king another king here at the great. Yeah, so Where's he at? Tell me wise men. Where's he at? Okay? Cool. No problem And then there's this order to kill all the innocents kill all these little kids if there's a boy under this age What was it two three? Yeah a couple years of age in this town. Yeah, go kill him You know, you're reading the christmas story. That's a few lines No, in siena, we're gonna make a mosaic Of all these soldiers marching on this town Grabbing these babies holding them up by their foot and stabbing them with a sword and just like blood going everywhere and the mom Screaming and then I thought to myself. Oh, yeah That was just a few lines in the bible, but if that order was executed There was a soldier that had to do it. Yeah, and there was a mother that felt the pain And then there was yeah, I got it that you know joseph took took jesus mary and fled to egypt under the generational hole for that town. Yeah, and so it was I don't know it just It brought the humanity to it in a way that I had never considered and so I was like whoa, okay Huh? Yeah, they didn't have youtube videos of that event. Did they but this is a pretty good representation Granted all of the people in the in the art they were lily white they were european looking They weren't of middle eastern descent which I mean everywhere christianities gone people depict the characters to look like themselves We've got native american churches. I mean we we live in a very native american part of the mountain west And there's a ton of church piscopole lutheran evangelical baptist And the poor trails of all of these characters Look native in their art. Why the heck wouldn't it? Yeah? I mean one of the central themes of christianity is that god took on flesh That came to be with people to be understood by people Because it's I think it's kind of hard to understand someone who's infinite But god's like, yeah, I mean, this make a little more sense like there you go And so the idea of things being incarnational in christianity Really lends itself to people seeing themselves and their physical attributes and their environment in the stories of the bible I'd publish a couple teeny tiny little shorts no big deal from an easter procession that I went to in costarica last year Study in spanish down there took my kids to a good friday procession It's a parade that does the easter story the story of well the good friday story the story of jesus conviction under ponch Pilot then all the abuse he takes as he walks through the catholic stations of the cross We don't have that and Protestantism but most of them are in the bible. It's powerful man We walked along with all of that it affected my kids deeply But one of my favorite things about it was that the roman soldiers Their helmets it what goes on top of a roman soldier helmet. It's like the red comb Yeah, the red comb but it's not for them like these super long exotic bird of paradise feathers Oh, that looks almost kind of like mayan or aztec or something. That's cool. Why'd they do that? Well, I don't know because it's super incarnational and everybody everywhere is going to make the people in these stories Look like them east asia sub-Saharan africa So yeah, they were all lily white, but it's because it was in ciena so it makes sense to me It was neat. I liked it seeing the old art was really interesting. I really liked that the one thing from the whole trip that was You know, we had a couple of things we wanted to do For me the thing was bucket list item was pom-pay Did you make it? We did cool. I don't know that we should talk about that I mean, it's it's like a whole thing like I we could we could talk just just on pump Let me just ask you this question. Okay. How did it make you feel? It made me think about the whole bible differently the whole yes Because I saw the graffiti on the walls for the third chair Not everybody knows what the deal is with pom-pay the very quick version is in the 70s 80s 79. Yep 80 is that right august maybe Mountain suvius erupted which is a big volcano right next to Naples. That's the big famous city there sasa sorento Ish area right yeah, and more or less buried two towns hurt. I can never say right for a little anium Herculaneum that sounded good and pom-pay and pom-pay Pliny the elder was there Shuttling people back and forth out of the bay to try to save people and so there's a very vivid description Maybe written by pliny the younger Well pliny I don't they might have both been there And so it captured the imagination of everybody forever and all the way up into the 1700s everybody's like Something from the era of the bible is still just sitting there underneath some dirt somewhere right around here And I think in the 1700s they figure out where it was and they've been excavating since they're not done It's a whole city that's just frozen in time from the first century idea. It's just insane Yeah, but that could exist. I'll just give you a snapshot So I told Tara I was like this this is the thing. This is the the one thing I would like to do She's like absolutely so she plans this beautiful itinerary. She's really gotten good at this where she'll say okay We're gonna do this and you know when we went to Iceland for our 15th anniversary She's like we're gonna go to this place for this amount of time And then our next waypoint is here And then she plans in randomness for me Good, you know, she's like Structure and then there's your randomness you do whatever you want We can sit, you know, we can sit on a beach or we can go to a bookstore or whatever it is That's what we did the whole trip, but in Pompeii that was the only thing I asked for it was amazing But you asked how it made me feel yeah when we started we walked in to where the port would have been Okay, and the person that was with us said okay. This is the uh How do I well? I mean this is the brothel You're gonna walk in the brothel were you seriously looking for a tamer way to say that than brothel? Yeah, because I think this is easier. Yeah, this is where the women of the night. Yeah, yeah I was trying to figure it out. This is the brothel and so I was like how do you know it's a brothel And the guy that was with us said you'll see And I was like okay Go open. Whoa, yeah, whatever and so we walk in and imagine Oh, yeah, I don't this is a whole episode did well long story short It was very clear. It was a brothel we can talk about that later But what it did for me what visiting that town did for me is it made me realize that the Culture we think today. Oh, I made the culture so awful. We're but no we're nothing We got nothing the culture was so vile Back then and so when I think of sunday school flannel graphs of bible stories and oh look there he is with his coat You know the many colors, you know and you know we're thinking about bible stories and like oh How tame it was heck no, dude. This was a vile culture. It's a snapshot from 79 80 So that's 40 years after christ. It just brought it. I guess more like 50 years It just to me it made it real. It's like i'm walking the streets. I'm seeing the engineering I can imagine myself to be a roman engineer. How would I solve this problem? They did pretty good. Huh. Oh, you know what in that case they did better than I would have done The only difference between me and them is that I have more technology at my disposal There's been more errors made in engineering between them and me learn from to learn from that's the difference It was life altering. I think seeing that and you told me it would be yeah Yeah, yeah, it is for me It was when I unwrapped the present and it has been when I've had the opportunity to go back I've been lucky enough to get to italy a handful of times I mean that's almost all of them have been for work. Yeah, it's what you do I mean you go and you I mean you've researched stuff when you go. I know why you go It was great. You were able to point me in certain places Because this is I don't know I hope we get to go back, but I don't know that we will it's weird to think that way, man What? I've just started doing that too though I never ever ever even five years ago would have said as I leave a place Well, it could be the last time I ever see this maybe look back one more time, man Maybe just take it in not through Camera Look at it because bet you're not coming back And that is a function of math. Well, I mean, but it it is a fatalistic approach It's not fatalistic Okay, it could be somebody could say that because they're like I'm getting old. I'm gonna die I don't feel that way I'm saying that with a lot of these places I'm seeing because It was really meaningful and I really enjoyed meeting you little town on the Caribbean coast of coast orica at the very end of the road where only a couple hundred people live I really enjoyed meeting you. This was wonderful But this world is so very big And I really want to go see other parts of it But I don't know that I'll be coming back this way again. So I should retain it for me It isn't super fatalistic. It's more optimistic For all the beauty I've seen there's still so many more presents to unwrap But I am starting to think that way a little bit like yeah, I kind of want to get after this other place Well, the big reason I was thinking that way is it was such a financial stroke to do it Yeah, dude. It's a thing, man Like like it was it's not just something you're like, oh, we're gonna go do this. No, you gotta like mean it Yes, you're like, okay, so this is this is now a priority for us And and I gotta say it was worth it for the investment in our marriage I mean, I I gotta say it was I can think of a moment when I was walking down the street in this city I think it's called chinketerre or I they the five cities or whatever. Okay. That's kind of up north in the armpit sounds negative But you'll under I mean sort of the north West armpit of the boot. Uh-huh like moreover on the piece of side is Inquittari. Did you get over there after Pisa? Uh? I don't know the order of what we did things. I just remember walking down the street with a little paper bowl that had bowtie pasta and like very light tomato sauce And it's like man, I'm hungry. I can so I walk in this little place like hey, I need you know, what do you have to eat? Like we've got this to go. I was like, yes And so I'm eating it with my little wooden spoon. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I hate the way it feels. I don't know Yeah, and then just walking down the street and Tara went and got something else and we're like, hey We're gonna meet down at the port. You go get some food. I get some food And we'll just like explore a little bit and see what you know and yeah, it was I just remember that moment where the sun is setting over the water To the west and we both got our little pasta And we're sitting there and we're eating it then I went and jumped off the cliffs. That was pretty cool Unintered Unintered. Well done. Yeah, I bled a little bit because it's kind of that's injured You want that's the opposite of what you said. Well, I mean, I didn't get like maimed or anything Well, I didn't say unmeant. It was volcanic rock and so it was really sharp pointy. Yes pointy. It'll get you No, it was it was great. What do you love about Italy with when you're there with oh? Because you've been there multiple times with Camilla, right? You know what this neatly and symmetrically brings us back to the forum conversation. Okay, then we're on a little bit ago I love the layers for me Italy's awesome because I love the ancient culture But I still love the modern culture. I know a lot of people who travel to Italy are pretty hard on the people the vibe Rome is kind of dirty. It's true. Rome is kind of dirty in some places. It's clean and lovely in other places It's a major city What major city is lovely and clean and beautiful in the all of the downtown area at this point in the west They'd none. I mean people live there. They use it But that's part of the layers and that's why I like it It's stacked up upon itself and we don't even really know how far down it goes When you were looking at the coliseum did you by any chance go up the hill towards st. John's ladder and No, I don't know what that means. So st. John's ladder and is the church compound that is the that's the home church of the pope the Pope's home church is not the vatican or st. Peter's It is st. John ladder and they're in Rome. Not too far from the coliseum a little bit up a hill They've got the shrine of the holy stairs santa scala right there the stairs that Constantine's mother hollena went and grabbed from pilots palace that jesus ascended for his trial The story goes that he bled on those stairs and they made a whole shrine around it in Rome I mean it's really pretty cool lore whether you're into all of that or not So if you were to walk from the coliseum up toward santa scala What you would see is one very low dugout area that I think it's the old barracks for the gladiators right there That ring a bell at all. Mm-hmm. Okay. That's all right. It's like basement of the coliseum level in terms of layers But then if you go down the street a little further past the gladiator barracks The next thing that you get to is the church Uh, san colisto maybe and subastiano dang it. I don't remember whatever the point is Under that church. There's an old shrine to mithras the bull god That was one of the more obscure eastern gods that there was a little cult of in rome That got real hot before the time of christianity And so you can go down there and you can see where they did their rituals and like Super weird ancient pagan stuff. Oh, I don't even know if that's the lowest layer There I mean back to like Romulus and remus stuff of legend kind of level when you go underneath that church and see the shrine to mithras under there Then above that you've got ancient christianity then above that You've got medieval christianity then above that you've got baroque christianity Then above that you've got more modern accoutrements of the church as it exists today And it's all stacked Ground level just keeps going up for millennia there And at any given place you just take a core sample and go straight down And you're going to see the eras of 50 famous names that you've heard of 20 famous events that you've read about or had in history class And as you walk through the city Well, there's different amounts of cultural erosion or archaeological erosion in different places So you see a cutout wall and you just that's the history you see right there It's all stacked up like a neat cross section that you get in a nicely illustrated history textbook or something The forum is where all that stuff happened, right? That's what you're talking about the it's called the roman forum and that's where senate was and all that right? It's where everything was okay. The forum is just The downtown of downtown areas So I remember being on the far end of that opposite the coliseum Okay, and seeing a column there's a few columns that are still standing and behind me there was a wall and there was a brick facade on the wall And behind that brick there was concrete The wall was filled With concrete and an older wall that had broken up that they just threw in with the concrete as backfill for the wall Huh, the one thing I wanted to do as an engineer because we've done a lot of concrete stuff in the past my old job I wanted to take my fingernail and I wanted to scratch it and feel the bonding of because I always heard about roman concrete. Yeah, sure and I and I couldn't do it because If everybody did that there, I mean, that's Thousands of years like how many tourists went through that way and if every tourist did that so I become tian ethical mean I was a good little boy and I didn't do it, but I really really wanted to yeah But you're absolutely right seeing So in that so there's a column behind me. There's a brick wall that brick was made by somebody But inside that was concrete and inside that concrete. Yes. We're more bricks And so that's how many thousands of years am I looking at right there of human hands touching this yes aggregate and this stone Did it quit? Does it feel like that's not recording right now? I think we just discovered that the Audio quit running so I guess we're just switching to the backup mics Yeah, whatever whatever. All right now. We're on the back of mics. I don't know when that happened I guess we're fixing to find out. Yeah, the forum To me is a metaphor for what I love about it. Yeah, because You walk down and then you get the arch of Constantine and Titus Those are I mean the the distance time wise between Constantine and Titus Is like the distance time wise between George Washington and now Maybe it's a little less than that, but it's close. I mean Titus is 70s ad I mean his arch commemorates the conquest of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple the arch of Constantine I it celebrates the victory at milvian bridge, which is in the early 300s ad so To somebody just walking through there. I mean you're like hey, there's an arch It looks like some old roman stuff on there that guy's got like a wreath or something There's a sword guy. Yeah, I great that looks roman And you walk a few hundred yards. I'm like, oh, there's another one that looks roman Look at that one right there and you walk a few hundred more yards and there's the arch of Septimus Severus There is far apart as our country is from its founding And yet it's all just stacked up in that one valley Between Three of the founding hills of rome where just naturally all the traffic sort of got funneled This was the natural place to come out of the neighborhoods And the little sub communities that made up rome from its ancient seven hills and assemble in this valley There's water down there. It's a good place to be business to have the markets Politics ended up happening there. It became the most coveted valuable property and It was across the millennia. It's like nowhere else to have all that history visible at once It's like with cgi. You could make a time lapse of parrots or london or something And you could see stuff from thousands of years all at once like kind of you know, semi opaque Can you picture that? Mm-hmm Except there Every you're seeing it all at once. There were two things in particular in rome that stood out to me like two Small thing not small things but anyway when I put my my body physically in that place I was just walking down a side street towards the spanish steps Yeah, and I saw a manhole cover And it said spqr. Okay. What do you make of that? I was like that's rad That's cool because that's that was the old What does it mean in latin? I'm sure you know more or less the senate and people of rome How do you say it in latin dino? Remember, okay, I could answer that question correctly at some point in my life like after I just got done reading it Yeah, but I don't know Yeah, so spqr which is you know, that was like USA, you know, yeah, that was the equivalent of And it was just right there on a manhole cover a modern manhole cover. I'm like, that's pretty cool It's sort of a flex isn't it? It is yeah, it is yeah, so there was that I thought that was really neat The other thing I thought was very interesting Was standing in the center of the coliseum and looking around and thinking about all the football games I've ever gone to and then just thinking man Just people from all over funneled in here and they got a ticket to sit down Granted they're watching somebody die. It was crazy. You know, you see it and you're like, oh, yeah old coliseum That's interesting. But when you're standing in the arena the arena the sand And you're looking around you're like Somebody stood where I am right now And they had very very different thoughts than what I'm thinking right now there and but they were a person and They were scared and they were Or whatever whatever they were trying to rouse the crowd or whatever it was they were feeling It was a very visceral memory just being there and seeing that and it's not something you get by looking at pictures I've seen the coliseum on however many like travel ads or Discovery card works for you, you know, and they're like people are running by the coliseum or whatever. No No, it's not a thing to put on a advertisement, you know, it's sobering. Yeah When you're there you're thinking and they're telling you about all the stuff. Oh, yeah This is where they would bring the animals up and you're like what It's just a thing and you look over to the side and there's these Some of these steps are still there and not excuse me not steps the seats are still there And they have the names of people carved into them They were season ticket holders or like this. You're like, hmm. This is wild It's a lot of watching people die. Yeah And then to know that that Existed and then there was this whole period of time where people just lived in the coliseum because the economy was wrecked You know after yeah, yeah after the collapse of Rome Yep, it was a camp. Yeah, it's just a strange strange thing. I mean, I guess I would say we're having problems with our audio We should probably address that here, but I don't know what do you want it? It's working. I mean, my thing's recording is your thing recording. Yeah, I think it's recording. We're just on backup audio whatever Yeah, people understand. Thank you for encouraging me to do that and For answering all of our travel questions, so we were reaching out and asking all that But man, it was it was really interesting and I think I think it was special It makes me want to go read more and go back with more mastery, but again, it's it's quite the stroke to to go there This episode of no dumb questions is brought to you by the patrons and a while back Allison who helps us out with the patreon stuff and some email stuff as well She's great and completely gets it She reached out to some patrons. It's like hey If you felt like it We would love to have you record something just record a basic message who you are Maybe how long you've been listening or whatever and why you choose to support the program And then we might just put that in an episode And so I think we have one that came in this time around. Who is it? What do we got? Uh, yeah, this is Libby. Uh, let me go ahead and click on this thing and fire it up. Let's see what Libby has to say Great Hi, this is Libby from Washington state I have been listening to no dumb questions pretty much since they released their first episode I love how destined and not relate to each other I enjoy learning new things and I gotta admit their discoveries of the recordings of testicles and barnacles have been life-changing I've been supporting since April of 2018 That's awesome also Libby has a better like audio recording setup than we do apparently Yes, well and the primary partner for better audio recording setup is her voice I know I bet she does I bet she does something voice wise professionally Yeah, sounded like NPR or advertising quality and Now people are going to notice the obvious reduction in quality when it comes back to us It's kind of embarrassing. I hadn't anticipated that Libby, thank you so much for supporting. We're we're grateful It's really fun to hear from like people why why they support and uh, I don't know It's it's fun to know that these silly little conversations we have are actually positive for people. Yeah indeed Libby, thank you. Seriously. That was very very kind of you and uh, thanks to everybody else as well who supports program at patreon.com slash notom questions Absolutely. Thank you. All right. Let's get back at it You asked me at the beginning. You said what would you do? Mm-hmm. What would you do? I guess I'll ask you first for maximum romance Yeah, and when you tell me you know a lot of things So tell me in a way that someone who's never been would understand I'll go first You go for it because I was thought but you go for it. Yeah. Yeah, I would say Venice was awesome Venice was interesting. It's a city that has Waterways for streets It's just very very interesting and I had the best pizza pizza in my entire life in vinace And I will chase that piece of pizza until I die Fair enough. We went over towards the east or not the east the west coast Something about seeing the sunset over the water was really really cool. Pompay It's not romantic, but it did change my perspective on life. Rome was cool. I felt like it was a city of high crime Uh, yes my family and I feel that way too So I wouldn't say Rome was romantic Which is an odd saying really you didn't feel romance stuff in Rome Because it's literally right there in the name Doug Well, I mean like trevy fountain was awesome going into the uh the pantheon Holy cow seeing the art at the uh, oh gosh. Tell me what what a much ronavatic museum the vatican museum Yeah, that that was incredible. Yeah, I'll tell you the one thing that I remember more than anything else Um, we're driving from point a to point b through tuscany Driving in italy is very very difficult. So I had a stick shift fiat Awesome and terra Every time we come up on a really weird intersection and you know, it's clear. We're about to have a wreck And I navigate it safely. She'll reach over and pat me on the arm and say you're doing great Meaning hey, we didn't die. Good job But I remember We were told not to stop near Naples because of the crime But we were out of gas and we had to stop near Naples And we were hungry and we get on the gps and we're like well it looks like there's a gas station restaurant It was the best kind. Yeah, that's what you want when you could hitle me So it was a sunday and we went and there was this gas station I walked in and then my broken Italian. I said, excuse you. Do you have a table? I mean it's just for two And they said yeah, we do today is seafood Breeding seafood today. I was like sounds great table for two So we went and we sat down tear went and washed her hands and when she came back they had served us pasta with Everything Seafood You know like when you picture a fisherman's net And he got like the big fish or like the shrimp. Yeah, there anything like that And then you have the other stuff in there. I mean like tires and boots. Yeah, that's the stuff that was in the ball It was an entire it was a lot of a lot of muscles And a lot, you know, there were some clams and then there was an entire family of octopus Oh Little bit of octopus. They had a little head some of them had five legs instead of eight. I don't know moving around No, they were dead that a quintupus. I think so. I don't know. Okay, but i've no idea But tara and I were sitting there at this gas station And there was a birthday party happening behind this and there was a few guys smoking to our right yelling at the Yellen at the tv over the soccer game that was happening And that is not what you think of when you think of romance in italy But it was but it was because we were so out of place and we were so uncomfortable, but we were there Yes octopus. Yes. Yeah, perfect. And you know where I don't think you get that experience on the emulfi coast Yeah, I mean, it's like going to yellowstone the wrong time of year. Yeah, it's beautiful. I think yellowstone is romantic I think the wild is romantic But if you go to yellowstone the wrong time of year, it's a traffic jam with the occasional bison Would you like to sit in a traffic jam with the occasional bison for the next nine hours? Sweet go to yellowstone the wrong time of year. Do you want to see things that would otherwise be pretty but are instead incredibly frustrating? Go to one of these coastal locations that are just a traffic jam in italy and just sit there But if you want to go and do something that's just downright weird um Get off the plane at the airport in rome and ask the first roman looking person you can find you scoozy dovey restaurante uh della stazione de gasolina They're gonna look at you weird, but you're gonna have memories Yeah, I mean no one does that no one is looking for the stupid gas station restaurant in crime riddled napples But that's why it's rad We went and we're looking at Nero's gardens. They're not really fleshed out But that's where Nero after the fire he blamed christians for it He took polls and he didn't do it himself He probably had his guys do it and ran him up people's butts so that they would just sit up there and impaled them Yeah, you impaled them so that you slowly slide down the thing dipped him in pitch Used him to light his gardens one of the most savage abuses of power in the history of the west And it happened in these gardens. I'm standing over there I was just like I just want to go here in the evening and imagine what it would be like To be in these gardens in their prime in Nero's golden house But lit by people who nearly 2,000 years ago would say they believe the same stuff. I believe today Hmm. I just wanted to think about that. The last time I was there. I was thinking about that Some sketchy guys came and started lurking kind of is like um What's a movie with will smith in new york with the vampire? Uh I am legend. It was like I am legend Like as the shadows crept these guys would creep and we were still in the light And i'm watching and the kids are just having fun and taking pictures in front of the coliseum because that's across the street from Nero's garden I'm looking at this going Okay gang. We gotta go snap the little circling finger thing that means we're done and they know That when I say that it means I see something you don't we're leaving immediately And we left and nobody ended up doing anything weird, but we're definitely getting Sculked upon by people who make a living of looking for unwitting tourists who are a little bit off the beaten path That's a great memory It's family magic that we were there and there was a little bit of risk and we were somewhere that Isn't really the kind of thing that you go to as a tourist to think about burning christians a couple thousand years ago But we went and it was cool and then the last time we were there You know, i've only been there once with my kids We got up the next morning and I wanted those sugar donuts that they have in italy Do these powdered sugar donut things i can't get them anywhere else. So I got one. I ate it No meat no protein just a donut to open my day Not two hours later. My hands are shaking. I just had a sugar crash It's our and i'm like we gotta go now kind of get the sweat going And we just sprinted to the first open pizza place we could find I explained in my broken italian like i've blood sugars low Can I just have something and sit down while my family orders and I was very patient with my garbage italian and gave me some breadsticks and I just powered them and down to coke and all I felt better and then everybody laughed at my shirts all sweated out and everything. It's not from exercise. It's from a Ridiculous fluke You know starvation crash as a tourist or whatever. Dude. It's the stuff like that It really is the go and just be there and do things Far more than I got the picture standing in front of the thing that everybody has And so to answer your question What makes it romantic what makes it awesome? It's what you guys did with your gas station quintopus Like He said It's the weird crap. It's the weird stuff that gets you totally out of your element. You're not in control There's some dude right now, baby I've been thinking I've been thinking you know next year's our 20 year anniversary Been thinking we need to get some quintopus She's like you Roy But she secretly is kind of smiling Roy Oh, you know the weight of my heart. No, not an exposed stud It's I'm really glad you went on that trip and I'm I'm glad you had romantic magic I really am it's I think that's so important I think it's dumb when people act like they're above it when they act like they're above The romance and the moment and the ambiance and the music and the light and everything feels different And I'm here and I'm sharing it with somebody that I love and this moment will never happen again Things will never align to be right here with the stupid things the beautiful things the old things the new things this moment is ours and It's it's something nobody can ever take away from us and when you are in the moment and you kind of have that Just brief awakening is like the veil gets pulled back about your reality and your life and love Like oh, dang. This is it like this is what I'm here for. This is awesome. Yeah, and when you both feel that at the same time That to me is what I mean by romance and I've experienced that a few different places But nowhere has more consistently paid off for that sort of feeling even if I'm just there for work Then it'll use a beautiful place and I've I've really savored being there with people I care about I'm glad you got to do it Yeah, I appreciate the uh recommendation When you say it that way it paints some of the moments in a different light for me the uh Oh gosh, we're gonna miss our train at the train station in pisa The only way we can get there is if we both hop on the scooter and you drive and I navigate And we're both on a scooter. Did this occur? This happened. Oh my oh, it was great And we couldn't walk like the reason it happens. We're supposed to walk back to the yeah Yeah, it was just 10 minutes and you know our trains in 12 minutes. We'll be fine We start walking and the whole street is blocked off to pedestrian traffic. We're like what? And then we're just like oh gosh solve the problem. Uh Scooter now Uh, you have to drive. I have to navigate. Okay. It's so it was great Did that I mean thinking about her saying You know you talked about the lantern swinging from the ceiling that gallolayo used to figure out pinhole emotion Yeah, it's over there in that building because she's a nerd. She was reading stuff. I was like what? It's over there. She knew it would freak me out. It's there. Yeah, it's there. Can we go? Yeah, we can go You know what she was doing. She was doing. Yeah, like those moments Yeah, when you talk about it that way it is Romantic there's two things that i'll chase forever. Okay, one of them is a piece of pizza that I had in venus And the other was some lobster linguini Because on the last night I was like, you know I want to take you out to dinner on a rooftop restaurant in robe And we did that And it was awesome because we didn't know anything and the guy comes over The Someone yay, is that what it's called? I don't know that sounded like french to me. I don't know I don't know the guy that tells you how to pair wine with food He comes over and he's like oh hello good evening. No, that's french. I don't know what i'm doing And so he's like talking to us just talk with your hands little people leave yeah, and I just turn around like here's a deal bro We have no idea what we're doing. We have absolutely no clue what you're saying and what we're doing And he goes, oh, what do you like I can't get away from the french accent Just being ignorant with her was beautiful and romantic and it was great I'm really glad you got to go. That sounds like an amazing trip a great way to spend an anniversary And I am excited to see what you come up with for the next one.
