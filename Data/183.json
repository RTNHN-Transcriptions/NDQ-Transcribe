It was. Did you mean to do that? Just frisbee it? Yeah, I mean you threw it like with your finger on the front so it had centrifugal force, it flew like a disc, it was flat, it was easy, it was easy to catch. It was a good throw. Thank you. Thanks for the moon pie. You're welcome. All of them, the 1994 smash hit Take Me Out. What do you remember about Franz Ferdinand? Take Me Out. You remember that song? It's a band called Franz Ferdinand. They're banding and a narrow narrow narrow. Banding and a narrow narrow narrow. Nope. Take Me Out. Do you still remember that one? I don't know. It was a big deal, it's a good song. Franz Ferdinand, if I recall, was the guy that was assassinated to start World War I. Perfect. Yeah, where was you from? I'm going to eat just moon pies. Are you okay? It's kind of bothered me to be honest. Why did you give me a moon pie to check if we turned on them? I'll put it away. No, it just says. No, I want you to be upset. You can take smaller bites. It's a tiny moon pie. Shrinkflation down to nothing. No, I stopped. No more moon pie. Do you remember where he was from? Was he from Austria? Nice job, man. Okay. When did you learn about Franz Ferdinand and his assassination at the beginning of World War I? I want to say it was 10th grade coach Cochrane's history class and his teaching style was interesting. He would walk in, everybody would sit down and he would just pull out a marker and he would write a whole whiteboard full of notes. Your job as the student was to copy the notes down and then regurgitate that on the test. Okay. Which you don't think would be effective. That's what I was about to say. I'm really far away from that. I know a little bit about Franz Ferdinand. Oh, you had it immediately. Yeah. Yeah, you're much closer to the band Franz Ferdinand's 2004 hit Take Me Out. You had nothing on that. No. It wasn't on the board. No, so if I recall, do you want me to tell you what I do? No. Keep going. My understanding is there was a parade and there was an assassin and the assassin wanted to take out Franz Ferdinand. Why? I have no idea. Sorry, we'll get to that. Who he was. I have no idea. All right. But what I know is the assassin had a pistol. He had a poison pill and he had some kind of grenade or bomb or something. Two of these. This was really good. And so my understanding is the parade is going by. Maybe there were two assassins. Anyway, there you go. The parade was going by and one of the assassins checking down or something like that. So this guy rolls up and he's like, hey, I'm going to assassinate Franz Ferdinand. And so he runs up and he shoots him with a pistol and kills him and throws a grenade at him or something. And then he takes this poison pill and he jumps off the bridge and the idea is he's going to drown himself after taking this poison. Yes. But the water was shallow and so he ends up at the bottom of the river. He didn't take the correct amount of poison. The grenade didn't go off and he's just laying in this muddy, what's supposed to be a river puking his guts out. But he did actually kill Franz Ferdinand. Is that what happened? That's close. There are a lot of elements there that are wrong. No, it's just it's a composite. It's really interesting to see the way memory works. Okay. On a very smart person who got taught a thing a long time ago. Okay. Every one of those elements is there. So the beginning of the story, there's a guy named Archduke Franz Ferdinand and he got assassinated. He's an Archduke? Yeah. Yeah. That is correct. Of Austria. Of Austria. Of Austria. The Austria-Hungary, Hungary, and Empire. Which is not Austria at the time. It's not like the country Austria that I think of right now. Yeah, a little different animal. We'll talk about that. Okay. Because the cool thing about Franz Ferdinand, it's a dynamic, very human story. He's an interesting guy. He's a likable guy, I think. He's a very sympathetic character who people loved at the time. There's not somebody you wanted to kill if you wanted to engender sympathy for your side. People liked this dude. Hmm. He's an interesting guy because of just who he was as a human. But it's also an interesting story because of what he represented. He held a very unique role and he was a metaphor for a way things had been done for a long time. And his death didn't just start World War I. It ended the old way. It took about four more years. But four years after his death, he died in 1914 in 1918. What he represented was gone. And the new world that you and I have been born into and have lived in was born in 1918. See, that's interesting, right? Okay. When I think Archduke, I think about monarchies. Yeah. Is that in the ballpark? Yeah. He was a Habsburg. Have you heard of the Habsburgs? I've heard of the Habsburg family. It makes me think of Germany and I think Queen Elizabeth had something to do. What if I'm wrong here, right? Well, Germany, they're a Swiss Austrian-German family that had influence over Europe for the better part of a thousand years. What? Significantly from the 1400s until 1918. They had tremendous influence. I mean, people talk about the Medicis and you could talk about the House of Hanover or Windsor or the Tudors or you could talk about the Plantagenets. These are all very powerful families in the history of Europe, the Merovingians or the Carolingians. But probably nobody has ever had more power as a family over more land, more people, more economics in some total in the history of Europe, including the families of Julius Caesar or Nero. Nobody has had this kind of sheer raw, total compound power that the Habsburg family has wielded. Yeah, they're a pretty big deal. Okay, so I'm just going to say something right from the beginning here. Sometimes when we do a podcast and we're looking at the waveform, Tina helps us. She edits and all this kind of stuff and we're looking at the waveform and you can see, O' Destin talked this much, Matt talked this much. You and I don't purposefully do it, but we kind of do it. We kind of like try to keep that 50-50. Yeah, like a coin or a gimmick to get people to sign up for Patreon. 50-50. No, no. We try to keep that like, by the way, the 50-50.com is what Matt's talking about. What? Yeah, who does? Go play. But we try to keep that pretty even. I can tell right now that you know a lot about this topic and I don't. You might be tempted to let me talk a lot in this just to kind of like even out the seesaw. I don't want to talk a lot. I want to learn about this stuff because this is fascinating. Okay. All those families that you just said, I've heard those names before. I've heard of the tutor. I've heard of Windsor Castle, of course. Merovingian, is that what you said? Yeah, the Merovingians were French family from the 5th and 6th century, the first family to become Christianized, Clovis, I think. It's a real famous Merovingian king. Okay. So all these things I've heard of them, but I don't know anything about them. And the beautiful thing about being a science slash engineering guy that is doing a podcast with a history guy, humanity's guys that I get to learn. So teach me. Same. Okay. Well, let's start with a little bit more about the Archduke. And then let's go backwards and we're going to spitball some stuff. This is a huge chunk of history. We're not going to cover it all. I don't know all of this off the top of my head. If you sat down with somebody and you were like, can you give me the plot summary of the first three Star Wars movies with Luke Skywalker and the Death Star and stuff? You're not going to get every scene exactly right, but you're going to get the big movements of the story, right? That's the goal of this conversation. Fair enough. Yeah. So familiarization. Yeah. And I will surely screw something up because as you can see, you haven't zero notes. No notes. That's just going to go for the big picture. Coming out of the brain. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. The Archduke, I said he was loved. He was beloved because for a lot of people, conservatives at the time in Europe, he represented the old world and the old ways and those old ways of an individual's way of conceiving about themselves and where they fit in the world, being tied to a family as opposed to a nation state was something that a lot of people really liked. They felt safe and secure in the idea that there are some very powerful families and these powerful families have ancestral control or claims over big chunks of Europe. And they all work it out with intermarriage and treaties and the occasional war and whatnot, but there are benefactor, the common person might think they provide for us. Is this the feudal system? It's sort of the next thing after feudalism. So what I'm describing right now, I guess I would call the early modern and modern European state. Okay. Yes, it is a national state, but it is profoundly tied to notions of monarchy, imperialism, and a family. I mean, really, it's a monarchy. Now, in this system, there are at times various electors, dukes and other prominent families who don't have a chance of becoming, say, an emperor or a regional king, but they have a electorate power to make a person an emperor of Europe or a king of a subregion of Europe. So there are little elements of aristocratic democracy. So Europe, what time frame are we talking about? We're talking about 1,000 AD to 1918 today. So they had enough unity so that there was a king of Europe? Oh, the Holy Roman Emperor was effectively the king of Europe at times. Okay. He governed over more people than most emperors of Rome would have governed over with that title. But I mean, you don't really think of the Holy Roman Empire as being that big a deal, because it's basically code for Germany. Okay. Most of the time that it exists. The Holy Roman Empire, I think of as being founded in 800 AD Christmas Day with the crowning of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III. And I think of it as ending during the Napoleonic Wars 1806, 1810. I don't remember exactly somewhere in the early 1800s. That's the end of the whole Roman Empire. So Napoleon ended it. He did. Really? Yeah. Gosh, I got to learn about Napoleon at some time. Napoleon ended a lot, dude. Roman currency, like I still have my little silver coins that was still being traded up until the time of Napoleon. Currency unified and was reformed under him. Holy Roman Empire crusader states like Odessa existed until the time of Napoleon. It's like all of that old, the very last vestiges of what Rome left behind and the classical world and the medieval world for whatever reason the Napoleonic Wars are when we started to make the shift towards something very, very new. More on that in a minute. Okay. What you need to know for this part is that the Archduke, Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, Sophia, they represented hope for conservatives who liked that system and were skeptical of the violence they thought would come out of the nationalistic mentality that the liberals of the day were embracing. So liberals like nationalism, conservatives tended to like the old way, the familyism, something more monaristic. Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. What do you make of the term nationalism in that context? So they want to draw political borders on a map and they want all those people to be unified under a flag. Yes. Very good. And they don't necessarily want that to be tied to a single person in power. Very good. Okay. Yeah. They still want to have wars in everything. Everybody likes wars, but they want to have their wars be for a red line. And how do they draw the red lines? Like how do you say this is France and that's Spain and that's Germany. Mostly rivers and languages. Okay. Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah. I mean, why do you draw the line between Spain and France? Spain and France. I would say that big. I mean, this Iberium peninsula. Yeah. Which is separated by the Pyrenees Mountains. Okay. They just draw it right there. Perfect. When the Muslims invaded and they turned Spain, Moorish in very distant times, they couldn't get past the Pyrenees. They got checked there in 732 AD by the Pyrenees Mountains right there on that little straight. Yep. They just covered the gap, the pinch point between Spain and France is the Pyrenees. Okay. So two different cultures emerge there. Great. Is that where the Basque people are? The Basque are north and slightly west of the Pyrenees. Okay. Got it. I think. So the French people, same kind of deal. There's a cultural unity, a linguistic unity, some historical unity, and it gets a little fuzzy as you get toward the east as to what is Switzerland. And what is Germany? And what is France? But you have a vague sense of where French culture would end and German culture would begin. Northern Italy. I speak German up there. Still to this day. In Italy. Yeah. Okay. Benito Mussolini did a big Italianization campaign in Northern Italy to try to sort of not to offend his buddies, the Germans, but we kind of want to unify Italy here. Then it sort of took. It sort of didn't. But if you go to Bolzano in Northern Italy, a ton of German, everything looks German. It doesn't look super Italian. So people have an idea of where they want to draw these lines. And conservatives are really skeptical at the time of what it looks like. They think it's going to be endless war and that people are going to get boxed out and forced into the wrong compartments. Or maybe they're just afraid of the future. I don't know. So the Archduke, he's kind of a hero of the old ways. And his job is one, he is the heir apparent to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And two, he is the inspector general of their entire military. Is that a term that still gets used in military circles? Inspector General, is that a thing? Yeah. I've heard that term. What do they do? Oh, shoot. I don't know. I mean, my thought is they keep everything above board, make sure everything's up to snuff. There's nobody stealing weapons and doing weird stuff with it, stuff like that. That's my assumption. I don't know. I've never been in the military. Yeah, I mean, either. I don't know this either. Well, you've been close to me. But when I hear the word review in terms of like a parade or a military presentation, I get the impression that that is an inspection, that the inspector general carries out. You line everybody up and he sits in like a box. And he makes sure that the marching is right and in order. And if he feels good about it, he's like, yeah, that looked pretty military. So he goes to Sarajebo in Bosnia. I always struggle with the second half of this Herzkovina. How do you say it? I don't. Okay, let's go with that. Fair enough. So many letters. And Sarajebo, you know, it's an ancient city. And the people there are ethnically and culturally very different from Austria. And in the, I would say 1860s, Americans, we forget about this part of history. Because we're all about the American Civil War in the 1860s. And then it's the Wild West for us. And then we don't really connect with the rest of the world on our history timeline until the Spanish American war, which is just a little blip in 1898 that involves Cuba a little bit. And then really World War I. So we sort of take 50 years off in our history from whatever the heck was going on in Europe to worry about finishing out conquering the American West and cowboys and Indians and all of that stuff. Look in our wounds from the American Civil War. Well said. So in there across the great sea, the emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire decides that they are going to annex Bosnia. Or Bosnia Herzkovina. Where's that at? It's Balkan. So if you have the boot of Italy and you go up and around the top of the boot past Venice and back down toward Greece. On the east side. Yes. On the east side of the, let me see, that's the Adriatic Sea. Over there, that's where all of the King's Landing was filmed in Game of Thrones. I mean, it's a beautiful place. But it's been a pretty tough run. There's been a lot of violence in Serbia, Bosnia. They used to call this Dalmatia part of this area. So a lot of people think it's not a good idea to annex this. The emperor does it anyway. And it just by force and declaration becomes part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Well, the way things used to be, that was fairly normal. You just do some paperwork and now this part of Europe is a part of this family's holdings because somebody married somebody or something. Nobody even really gets to know what happened. There's probably a proclamation. But in your daily life, you'd be like, okay, so what I use the same currencies and continue to go to work. And when somebody goes by and they look like a king, I should line up and be respectful. It's not like I'm going to fight the empire. Right. Right. Who cares? Most people never would have seen their king for 2,000 years in Europe. Nobody ever saw their king. They didn't farm us. Yeah. They just farm and you just pay your local lord. You don't really know or worry about the other stuff. Well, it didn't work out that way here. The whole lot of people in Serbia and in Bosnia, Herzkovina, they don't like the way this thing plays out. And they have a big enough sense of the world. I can imagine if your world is small and you're paying your local lord, you don't really care. But if your world suddenly starts to, I guess the whole world starts to shrink and you start to have a bigger understanding of the world around you, then you could start to get ticked off about this kind of stuff. Yep. And starting in about the 1870s in liberal Europe, who did political revolutionaries start to target to work them up to help them achieve revolutionary goals? I have no idea. Young people are old people. I would assume young people. Young people. Yeah. And the assassins who decide to kill the archduke in Sarajevo are very young teenagers. So this, okay, hold on. This assassination attempt is going to take place where? In Sarajevo. In Bosnia. Yeah. Is that where you're? Yeah, the lines are different, but this is historic Serbia, Bosnia. This is the area. So, Serbian are the ones who are mad. Why is he there? He's there to do a review because he's the inspector general. So he's going to go and check out the different troops, see what they're doing, I guess. Look at them. I don't really know. That's why I was asking him when inspector general does. So how long has it been since they did the fancy pants paper and just made things happen to when he's going to go on this parade thing? Less than a decade. Late 1860, it's either 1860s or 1880s. Oh, okay. So it's still like 30 years. Fairly fresh, but. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, it's been this way for a while. He goes on this. He's going to do a parade as well, and he's taking this procession through Sarajevo. And like you said, accurately, the assassins show up and they are armed. I'm not kidding, dude, with like softball-sized black metal bombs with fuses, like a cartoon character would have. But the Swiss family Robinson only not coconuts. Ah, yes, exactly that. Ahoy. I throw at the this metal bomb. And so a bunch of people are in the crowd when the Archduke and his wife go and check out a local bazaar and shop there, the guy who ultimately ends up killing him, a man named Gabrilo Princeps, a 19-year-old kid. He's there when the Archduke is out and about. Who made Gabrilo ticked off at the Archduke? Like, I think Princeps made himself ticked off, but there's a lot of debate about this. Some people think that the existing government of Serbia had something to do with it. Who knows? They wanted to create chaos and they succeeded in creating chaos. This episode of No Dumb Questions is sponsored by Company Cam. We had a brief conversation with Luke earlier on an earlier episode, but Company Cam is a software tool that you can use on your phone. If you run a contracting business, like, let's say, for example, you are a person that runs a crew. You can use Company Cam to take a photo of the job and make comments and notes and is geotagged and everybody on your team knows what needs to happen and what to do next. How would you say it, Matt? How about instead of how I would say it, I'm going to go with exactly how they would say it, because they just sent me over this 100-word Company Cam blurb, which I think is amazing, because it's unbelievably tight. Here we go. Company Cam, according to them, is a photo-based solution that makes it insanely easy for you and your crews to keep track of your contracting projects. Photos taken in Company Cam are automatically time-stamped, sent to the cloud, saved by project location, and available to your whole team. Then you use arrows, comments, drawings, and tags to add context to your photos, so everyone is on the same page. You create project timelines, photo galleries, reports, and professional before-and-afters right in the app. Know exactly what's happening at each job with every photo, video, and conversation in one place. All of that to say, it seems like the obvious application for this is contractors working on projects, things where you can't always be there to look at it, but you've got a bunch of people working on it. But I also feel like there are about a billion less obvious applications for this that could be super handy to anybody in any line of work. Yeah, absolutely. There's a ton of different trades that use Company Cam, whether you're a general contractor, you do HVAC, landscaping, like roofing. There's a ton of different things that you can use this for. Like if you're, I don't know, running a fencing company or a flooring company or plumbing, there's so many different things that you have to keep track of. And the beautiful thing is the photos keep a record of the job, so you can use that on the backside as well. I think the story is so cool. They ran this roofing company, your buddy Luke and his brothers Jake and Dane, they had this roofing company and they're like, man, somebody has to have done this. They make software that just explains everything that's happening on the job. And there wasn't an app that did that. So Luke just made it and it's awesome. How could people try out Company Cam, Matt? It's cake. You go to companycam.com and then, you know, it's real cool if you let them know that we sent you that way. You go to, when they ask how you heard about it, you go to the podcast tab and you enter ndq. And then you just try it out and they think you're going to like it and they will get in touch with you to give you a hand with getting things set up. If you need it, they're great at the hands-on support thing. And that's it. We're grateful to Company Cam. Luke for taking a chance with us to reach out to the note of questions audience, hoping that there'll be some people out there that want to try Company Cam. Thank you very much, Luke and team. So if you guys want to try it, go to companycam.com and just use ndq in the little podcast drop down when it says, how did you hear about us? That'd be awesome. Thanks again to Company Cam for supporting the podcast and thanks to all of you for supporting the sponsors. The archduke and his bride, Sophia, who by the way, she was low ranking nobility and he made huge sacrifices to marry her for love. That's very endearing to a late 19th century public. Habsburgs, they either marry within their own family, gross. They did it so much that their jaws turned into cash registers and their noses turned flat. I've got some Habsburg coins. I'm like, dude, if I look like that, I wouldn't put a coin. That's such a bad look. This looks like a misprint. It was so bad. I mean, basically, the inbreeding is what cost them the fact that they inbred changed to the whole world. Because it became dysfunctional. They killed off their own line trying to protect their family holdings. So here's a guy who's like, no, this lady, she's not my sister. She's not my cousin. She's not my mom, but I'm going to marry her anyway. Just get some new jeans in here. I want a kid without a shovel head. Yeah. Seriously, people make fun of Alabama. Come on. Get after the Habsburgs. They have it coming. So he marries this lady and it took years to get approval from all of the powers that be to even do the marriage. And in the end, it was a marriage of forfeit, which they call a morganatic marriage. Does that sound right? I have no idea. I think it's morganatic marriage, which means all right, you can get married as a nobleman, but it ends with you. Your children cannot hold office. Your children cannot inherit lands or titles from you. And your wife does not get to hold the title of queen or princess. Maybe I don't keep track of the English monarchy at all, but is that the deal with Camilla? What? Charles? Oh, Charles and Camilla, right? She's not the queen of England. I guess that confused me because your wife's name is Camilla. Oh, sure. So you can see how that confused me. No, I'm picturing the one who's associated with the English monarchy. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's a different Camilla. British monarchy. I have no idea. That makes sense, though. Okay. Morganatic. I think that's what it's called. It's some like super ancient term that means like a marriage in the morning. Oh, no, dude. What? I mean, you got me super interested. So I'm over here Googling and I looked up Sophie Duchess of Haughtenberg. I think who he married and I'm looking at her death date. Oh, that's not good. I spoiled myself. Oh, this isn't good. No. Keep going. I'm sorry. Yeah. She seems nice, too. She seems nice. Okay. It's a nice lady. Everybody liked these people. Okay. So they go, driving through Saria. They're supposed to have a bunch of armed soldiers with them, but people were sick or didn't show up. I don't know. I don't know. You're right. He's ugly. Yeah. There's something real. Well, the mustache is the best thing about him, dude. Yeah. Seems nice, though. Nice enough guy. Sure. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. He's 50 at the time. They're driving through town and they're way under protected from what they had ordered and what it should have been. And the black hand, which is the name of the assassin group, I say again, the black freaking hand. They came up with a name and everything. That's a really good name. It's a pretty good name. From the group of assassins. Yes. Intimidated. Branding's on point. They nailed it. But what, how would you use that? I'm with the black hand. I think you just nailed it. I think that's how you do it right there. Like in Treasure Island, the black spot. Yeah. You know, okay. Just like that. All right. It struck fear into my heart. Okay. I'm with you. So one of them, he grabs one of his bombs. He's a bomb thrower. This is, you heard that phrase before in politics or political discussion. Yeah, guys, just throwing bombs. He's just a bomb thrower. Okay. I mean, you hear that and you're like, I mean, don't you drop bombs? Who throws bombs? Really? Well, the black hand throws bombs. He lights one of his bombs with a little fuse. He's got his little snidey whiplash mustache. He's all gangly and teenage. He looks like a cartoon and he whips the bomb at the Archduke's car as it's rolling by in Sarajevo. It bounces off. It rolls under another car and blows up the car. So the bomb did work. It worked. The bomb bounced. He missed time to fuse, I guess. Oh, yeah. It'd be tough. He'd be jumping in. I wonder if like maybe they're like, oh, no, a bomb. And he grabs it and throws it away. That would be way better. Yeah. Heroically save us by throwing this right at our vehicle full of friends. Sorry, I'm the Archduke. That's awful. Sucks. Yeah. So they all get hurt and the Archduke is, I think mostly uninjured. He goes and does his event anyway. He has some sort of royal bank. He pulls a Teddy Roosevelt. Yeah. He just goes. When was Teddy Roosevelt president? When was he shot? Just before this. Really? This incident is happening in 1914. Roosevelt became president in 1898 because he was McKinley's vice president. McKinley got shot at the Buffalo World Fair summer of 98. So then Roosevelt, who was never supposed to be president, became president and turned out to be pretty good at it. Pretty awesome. Yeah. And then he had political infighting with his own party in the mid 1900s. Taft became president and we get to 1940. I just want to read this quote from Teddy Roosevelt. Okay. Friends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible. I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a bull moose. That is the coolest quote ever. I'm sorry, but we're with the Archduke. Okay. So, so Teddy Roosevelt 1912 takes a bullet more than a couple hundred bullets to stop me evil. From the drug. That's exactly what it's from. Most important film of our life. All right. So, got it. So it goes to the thing and then afterwards he's like, we should go visit the people who got hurt with the remember the bombing. We should go check in with them at the hospital after he does his talk or whatever. Whatever it is. Yeah. Again, broad strokes. Okay. The assassin in the meantime, he run the black hand. Yeah. He is the guy who you remember. It wasn't Gabriela Princeps who jumped off the bridge, but the first assassin, he jumps off the bridge and de shallow water, chooses outdated cyanide capsule. Yeah. He's vomiting. He's getting beaten by people. I think he got arrested and stood trial, I think. I don't know, but it's a comical. Okay. So that was some money that tried to throw the bomb. Yeah. That's the person that jumped off the bridge. Yes. Okay. If I recall correctly. Okay. And we're going to allow for errors in this because you have no notes in front of you. Thank you. Okay. So the trip going back, well, stuff starts to heat up and there's a spook, there's a scare. They make a wrong turn on their very quick route to go visit at the hospital, the archduke and their driver. They make a wrong turn down a closed off street or something like that. And they're like, Oh, no, that's not right at all. Well, in the midst of all of this, 19 year old Gabriela Princeps is super sad because they didn't assassinate the archduke. And he's just walking along in Sarajevo, minding his own business with a pistol, feeling sad that they didn't assassinate very well. And then who should turn down the street that he's on? The archduke. And he's like, what the heck? Why should shoot him? And so Princeps fires two shots, I believe. I'm seeing its Prince sip without an S at the end. Prince sips Prince Gabriela Prince sip, no S. Correct. Okay, thank you. And he fires two shots and hits Sophie and hits the archduke. Golly. The archdukes last words according to a bunch of witnesses were not to express pain in him being shot. But he's trying to keep his wife together and saying like, my dear Sophie, you have to live for the children. And then they both die. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Wow. Wow. But she doesn't. She does. She dies. Golly, she seemed nice. They both seemed nice. Although I'm, you know, checking his Wikipedia page out, one of the things I found was him hunting. He killed a big elephant. Who did? The archduke. So he's a terrible man. He's a terrible man. We should cancel him. Dude, I don't want to kill a big elephant. I don't either, but it just, I don't know. I just said like if anything has. Oh, okay. Here's the pistol. Oh, they still have it. You can actually see the pistol. Where do they have the pistol? Where do they? Prince sips browning gun presented as evidence in the prowl. Okay. To the courtroom, he said, I am a Yugoslav nationalist aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs. And I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria. The plan was to unite all south Slavs. It was understood that Serbia is a free part of the south Slavs had the moral duty to help in the unification to be to the south Slavs as the Piedmont was to Italy. In my opinion, every Serb, Croat and Slovene should be the enemy of Austria. And that's something he said to the courtroom. Gavrilo Princeip said to the courtroom. So he's referencing there the Italian unification that had just occurred. The German unification had just occurred as well. So he's a young man looking at the world changing. And he sees the heavy boot of oppression of the Austrian Hungarian Empire as being the opposite of what he romantically is seeing happen in northern Germany, where Prussia and Otto von Bismarck had led the unification of the northern German states and in Italy, where Garibaldi and Immanueli had laid down their arms to each other. It looked like two rival forces that were going to meet in the middle. And now they're going to have to kill each other to figure out who gets to own Italy. And they don't. And so there's all of this romantic ideal of laying down our rights to form this nation state together. I mean, all very much formed and influenced by the French Revolution, the values of the American Revolution and Prussia, forgive me for putting an S on his name earlier, but I mean, he's wanting the same thing for his part of the world. And that's the kind of language that he's invoking there. It says here that before we could fire a third time, the pistol was rested from his hand and he was pushed to the ground. He managed to swallow a capsule of cyanide, which failed to kill him. So he tried to kill himself as well. Wow. 19 years old. Dang. I want to kill a dude and his wife and then choke down some cyanide and die. Wow. That's dark. Very dark. Oh, he's in the black hand. I don't know if you remember that. I do. Now that you mentioned it. Is it literally called the black hand? I think that's the name of the team. I look it up. Black hand. Yeah. The black hand. Wow. Okay. It's pretty cool. Sounded. A Serbian secret society with ties to Serbian military intelligence provided the conspirators with weapons and training before facilitating their reentry into Bosnia. I tell you one thing, the cyanide guy on the black hand garbage. He is not good at his job. Fired. How hard is it, man? How hard is it? I know, right? Come on. You have the self-destruct button. Make it so it works. Dude didn't even die of hanging or firing, squatter anything. I think he got like tuberculosis and died when he was 22 or 23. Really? This is kind of an anti-climactic ending for a dude who did not know what he was doing. You don't think so? I mean, there's no way he could have understood the implications at age 19 of what he was ending and what he was initiating. Those two gunshots right there, some people could argue that all they did was formalize something that was already a political reality. But you could also argue that those two gunshots changed planet Earth as at least as we are recording forever. Really? Yeah. So all he wanted was to not be under the rule of Austria. Which would require a reimagining of everything about how Europe does nation states, countries, kings, monarchs, democracy. I mean, it sounds simple to just be like, I just don't want to be under the boot of Austria. Okay, cool. Me neither. I don't want Austria to rule me. I really get that. But to make that happen would require a reimagining of everything. And that reimagining was not going to happen without a ridiculous, protracted, violent boots on the ground, grizzly, bloody war that just isn't going to make sense to us even a hundred years later. World War One on paper makes no sense to the modern viewer. So this is a 380. The caliber was a 380, which is the same as nine millimeters, just a shorter bullet. The pistol has FN on the side for fabric nationale. But what does that mean? That's a company in Belgium that is really good at making firearms. But you don't see nobody's saying FN anywhere in any of these articles. It's just on the pistol. It's just an unassuming pistol. Nice catch. That's interesting. This one little pistol changed the world in the hands of a young man that didn't understand what was going on, maybe. So I guess what happened from there? Like, how do we get from these two people died to World War One? Because I don't know if you know this, but a lot of people died in World War One. Were you aware of that? Yeah, I read about that one time. Okay, to answer that question, we got to go the other way. The simple answer is there were a whole bunch of alliances. And over the course of the next few days, people started looking at their alliance sheet. Like they got out there. Who do we have to kill if somebody attacks other people's spreadsheet and had to go through and line up the columns and be like, okay, but this wasn't an act of war. This was an assassination of a single person. So why why wasn't it for the Austrian Hungarian Empire declares war and initiates immediate military action against the Black Hand. Why Serbia? I mean, the idea of attacking a terrorist organization is something that didn't exist until G.I. Joe and comic books and then didn't exist in politics until 2011 or 2001. I mean, global war on terror. Right. You're not fighting a government. You're fighting ISIS. That's weird. How do you prosecute that war? I don't think that had really been thought through in 1914. You attack the region, you bring them to their knees, and you get them to bend the knee, swear fealty or whatever and kiss the ring of regal authority. Once again, that's how we've done it for as long as recorded history exists in Europe. Why would we change that today? Because you shot a couple people. No, no, no, we're not going to negotiate. We're going to crush you and we're going to make your leaders send forth your leaders and they'll swear loyalty to their true emperor once again. But the Archduke Ferdinand is not the king. He's not. He's the heir apparent. Yeah. So he is set to be the king and soon. Is there another who was ahead of him in line? He killed himself. Rodolfo. Rudolf. It's something like that. He was viewed as not being particularly fit for the role and he took his own life. The Habsburgs are already on thin ice, just in terms of their family tree. There's not much left there. So the Archduke's a pretty big deal. Which the family tree is pretty straight. Yeah. It's like a telephone ball. It's been folded back in on itself several times. Yeah. On paper, it just looks like there were a bunch of entangling alliances. That's what you get taught in school. And then eventually everybody was at war. Well, the dominoes that fall more specifically are the Austria-Hungarian Empire declares war on Serbia, Germany that recently reunified northern Germany, the German Reich, the German Empire as it was called at the time. I mean, they're ethnically, culturally, linguistically very closely tied to Habsburg, Austria, and they throw in with them. But through the course of the last few hundred years. Okay, stop. So does that mean that Germany were the good guys in World War I? No. Well, you just said, well, the central powers are the bad guys. We're not with the Austria-Hungarians on this. Hold on. They're the bad guys. Oh, really? Yeah. But they just, I mean, somebody just got assassinated. Yeah, they have a legitimate gripe. I'm not arguing that. Once you get past the assassination of the Archduke and Sophia, just forget all about your sympathies after that. That's the spark that blew up the barrel. Now we're worried about the barrel and which way the explosion is going to go. It's not about is this justified or not anymore chaos ensues. Here's my assessment of it. I'm just some guy other people might assess it differently. What's the biggest European power? Well, who are the European powers who have colonies all around the world? Just real them off. Who are the big ones, big players in colonialism? The UK? Yes, huge. Are we talking about now or back in the day? Yeah, back in the day. I mean, who wouldn't colonize the world? Whose languages are around the world? Forget Spanish. Huge. Yeah. The French. Huge. Belgium got to the game late. Belgium and the Dutch. The Congo. Yeah. Yeah. The Dutch tried. They got a little late. I don't know if any Italian colonies are there. Italy was connected with Ethiopia for a long time. It wasn't? That connection dried up violently under Mussolini. Okay. But not a lot. I would say the big ones are the Spanish and French and the UK. Yeah. What's the big German colony? I don't know of one. Down in, no, I'm thinking about Belgium, the Congo. So, yeah. So the Germans were kind of upset about that, I guess. There we go. Okay. But now if I ask you this follow-up question, name the five historic gigantic European superpowers. It's real them off. Who you got? Germany. Yes. It's on the list, right? Yeah. Italy. Squarely on the list. Yeah. Germany. Yeah. Going back to Roman times. Germany's on the list. Yeah. They just happened to be in a place of Habsburg inspired political chaos, right when the UK was unencumbered by that or England at the time, then the UK in the 18th century, they were unencumbered. So Germany, they were just built wrong when the colonial frenzy happened and they got delt out of it. How do you get back in the game? The whole world is dumping money in the 1700s and 1800s back into all of your continental rivals in Europe, but you're getting nothing. Like maybe some diamonds in Namibia. You just lost. Super super bad. Everybody started playing risk and you were taking a nap. And then you come back to the table and everybody's getting stuff and you're not and you're upset about it. Yep. Okay. Germany peaked early. Germany peaked with the Holy Roman Empire, Charlemagne, the era after that. But there's one other huge event that happened right when the age of exploration was starting. It happened right when colonialism was starting and that's the Protestant Reformation. What country did the Protestant Reformation happen in Germany? There you go. So Germany has just had not even bigger fish to fry, just other fish to fry. Germany got roped into defending the eastern part of Europe along with Poland and the Hungary. They were the Ottoman Empire? Yeah. They were just busy. So they didn't get to do it. So the Germans are going to have this narrative. I don't know this firsthand. This is me speculating I've never asked a German from the 1800s what they think about this. But I think they've got this narrative that says, so let me get Z straight. All of y'all careful Whitman going conquers the world. While we defend your back from the Ottomans and we get nothing. It's a legitimate gripe. Okay. It's a legitimate gripe. So where there is all this intermarriage and family connection through England and Spain, Switzerland and Italy, they're all married together. It's the German people who feel bear the brunt of some big political and military crises during the age of colonialism. They get dealt out. A lot of historians would look at how things shook out after the assassination of the Archduke and say it was an old world way of thinking, a pre-nationalism way of thinking on the part of Germany to say, here's some chaos and we need to reposition ourselves and reassert ourselves as the Holy Roman emperors. I mean, we're the nation of the Holy, we're the heir apparent to Rome. We call our leaders Kaiser. It's Caesar for crying out loud. And yet here we are taking a backseat to all the U-clowns. So I think a lot of people, a lot of historians would say it was an opportunistic move on their part to fix some of the entangling intermarriages and mess and get Europe back in order with Germany playing the role that it ought to play. Whether that's fair or not. I don't know. Surely there's a counter narrative to that as well. But however it works out, dude, by the time 1914 rolls around, there have been so many stupid little wars and treaties of this and treaties of that and the concordant of this to sort out the family tree problems of the Habsburgs. That has been both a stabilizing thing for 500 years in Europe and a chaos inducing thing for 500 years in Europe. Because the fate of Europe seems to ebb and flow based on how productive the most recently powerful Habsburg couple has been in producing children and whether those children are competent. The fate of a whole continent rising and falling on that, I get why people were a little sick of it. But when it worked, for example, during the reign of Charles V, one of the most powerful Habsburg emperors, he was the emperor during the Protestant Reformation. It has a very unifying effect and you got one emperor, one family that's controlling Spain and France and Germany and the low countries and Italy and Austria and Hungary. That's great. But then you run into an inbreeding crisis like during the age of Leopold and you've got an idiot and future instability at the head of everything. I mean, the emperor has no clothes. Well, that's awfully chaotic. You don't want the fate of all of Europe being held in the hands of some bad family decision making. That entangling alliances that exist are all deals that were made to say, okay, the daughter of this family will marry you and that'll unify Northern Germany with Southern Spain. And then this marriage over here will fix the fight that's been going on between these two French regions. But now Napoleon's here. I think that cancels that one to make a new one where we, I mean, get out your thumbtacks and red yarn, right? Yeah. I mean, it's impossible. So they don't even all know who to declare war on immediately because it's not like it's emotional or they're mad. They got to get out the spreadsheet and go through it to figure out who they're supposed to hate and kill now. Wow. It's a mess. Within a month, everything was going down, right? Within a month, the fighting started. Yeah, not everybody was in at that point. The US came in late in the game. Why did the US get involved? That might be a story for another day. A lot of people didn't want to. But the narrative that got pitched to bring in additional belligerents like the US was this has got to be the war to end all wars. This is the war that resets all of the treaties and marriage packs. We're trying to fix problems that were set in place in 500 AD as the Roman Empire started to flounder during just after the reign of Justinian. We're trying to fix stuff that started to go wrong all the way back then. We've had a quest for reestablishing order in Europe in the way the Romans provided order in Europe that's gone on for a millennium and a half. People like Woodrow Wilson, the president of the United States at the time, were like, this is our chance. It's going to cost a lot of blood and a lot of treasure. It's going to be very expensive. But there's a noble quest for our young men to pursue to finally clear the decks of this old world way of thinking and embrace the modern nationalistic understanding of how the world should be divided up. Things will now be decided by true honest sincere democracy. Not the whims of these inbred families will simply do away with the trappings of the old world and build a new world. Will it cost us a lot? Yes, it will. Will it be worth it? Yes, it will. And the boys lined up and they got in the boats and they sailed to northern France and they dug trenches real deep and they lived in the trenches. And it was the worst thing humans had ever built for themselves on that scale ever in the history of ever and all of that hope and all of that optimism that people felt about the goodness that would come with our new nationalistic build for the planet died in those trenches. Those boys, the ones that came back, they came back screwed up. It's like a chunk of our heart as the West got destroyed over this fight and how we fought it. And I'm getting pretty serious here, but I don't think that chunk is healed. And dangerously, I think we're getting too far away from it to have living memory of it to understand that that's even a big part of what's wrong with us. What we did to try to make this new world we wanted to live in, it was a monkey's paw. This is a trade off. We didn't understand the value proposition. If you wreck the soul of the people who you're trying to make happy in the process of trying to make them happy, have you really succeeded? World War I, it was four years, but it's going to be a long time before that societal wound on the soul of humanity heals up. I fear that that's where we're at again now with what Russia's doing to Ukraine. What do you mean? Oh, what you just said. I mean, if you wreck the societal soul of the people that you're trying to make happy, I think that's happening. It's something that scares me a little bit. Yeah, these things matter. And of course, the war ended 1918. That's the problem. The asymmetric warfare that's happening now, the war just kind of keeps going. Yeah, like Orwell's vision of war. Yeah, we've always been at war. Yeah, yeah, with Oceania. We've always been at war with Ukraine. We've always been at war with Russia. Yeah, just do it forever. Eventually, it becomes baked into the economic assumptions and projections for the upcoming year. Like I'm mapping out my year. I'm trying to just plan my day over here. I'm a number cruncher. So we're going to have the wars still, right? Okay, we wouldn't want to end that early. We can end that maybe a year from now when we do next quarter's budget projections. But it gets so baked into the fabric, it soaks into the fabric of all your assumptions about everything. What would winning even look like? When does it go away? That kind of warfare, it's bleak. I think of the drug cartels in Mexico. Have you followed any of that a little bit? Yeah, I've been following that. Not crazy, but like it feels like you have these different people that are over certain regions and they're jockeying for position and power and all this kind of stuff. And they're being extremely brutal, extremely brutal. Yeah. And the weapons are starting to employ are modern. And it's like a legit shooting war. It's not cartel violence. Like we're approaching straight up war. It's wild, dude. Okay, well, anytime we're talking about a war in this context, the question is what is the end game? Yeah, right. So how does that end? A couple of people get more power and more. I mean, eventually, nation states are going to have to step in and be like, hey, we're done with this violence and like a Salvador. Is that what happened? Oh, yeah, they elected a new guy, like a hyper authoritarian law and order guy. And he just did a roundup. Everybody, all the local police know who all the gang members are. So yeah, we're going to suspend some civil liberties and we're just going to arrest all the gang members, like a child's fantasy of how would you solve? How would you defeat gang violence? Well, we need more education. One person in the room is always going to be like, just literally arrest them all, put them on an island. Yeah, that's how they want to act. They're like, what, 1% of society's ruining it for everybody, put them on a freaking island. That guy won in El Salvador, made Bitcoin the official currency of the country, and then arrested all of the gang members in a gigantic Friday, the 13th French King style roundup of the Knights Templar just kicked indoors, rounded them up, put them all in jail. You know what happened to crime though? What they went away completely. They don't have that anymore. It's unbelievable what the on paper results are. But what do you think that my civil libertarian brain does with that? Like, oh, yeah, great. That's awesome. And now we have a new problem. Yeah, what happens when the next person gets elected? What happens if they decide that bald dudes in their 40s who like tennis are the real threat? But now I guess you can just arrest me even though I didn't do anything. I don't get a trial. What? So take me back to this assassination. Yep. What did Princeip want to happen? And did it actually happen? Yes. And yes. I think that's about as good as what he could have hoped for. I mean, the one thing that I think Princeip would have liked to see happen that didn't is massive stability in Serbia. That didn't occur. I'm not sure you could say that has ever fully occurred since then. Crossroads of Europe. It's a tricky place to bring stability to. I don't think he got what he wanted for Serbia. But what he wanted from the quote that you just read a little bit ago here, what he wanted was to end the old way of organizing society in Europe. And that job was about halfway done by the time of the assassination. The Italians and the Germans and the English, the British, the UK, they had all made that leap. The French, they were still trying to figure out who they wanted to be after Napoleon, flirting with having emperors still even at that point. In the 1800s, late 1800s. So Europe was halfway reformed to a modern nationalistic way of thinking. And two bullets from Princeip's little browning and four years passage of time effectively completed the process. It ended most of colonialism. Almost none of the old colonial structure existed after 1918. And in 1918, the last Habsburg emperor abdicated his hand of the whole thing back over and was like, I'm going to play no part in what you do in rebuilding your nation. Really yours. That was it. That was the end of the Habsburgs. There might still be some. There's a joke about it on 30 Rock. Maybe like Steve Buscemi or something played Habsburg emperor. Is this Steve Buscemi? Is somebody? No, it was Paul Rubens. It was Pee Wee Herman that they had played the last Habsburg in an episode of 30 Rock with Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin. And they made him up so his face was drooping off with his cash register chin. It was truly remarkable. This episode of Notre Dame Questions is brought to you by the patrons. And we've been doing a thing lately. I don't think the thing has a name, but maybe you could describe the thing, yeah, basically we kind of had a, I don't know, an imaginary hat and we drew names out of this imaginary hat and we sent messages and we're like, Hey, would you be willing to mention via an audio recording why you support Notre Dame Questions? And would you make fun of Matt on that? I don't think we specifically just kind of give people an idea of what you get out of being a patron. That's kind of the idea. Yeah, most of that sounded exactly right. Almost 100% part to that we're right. Well, that's basically it. And so we've had a bunch of these come in. We've, we've played a few of them for people and I think they've all been absolutely fantastic. But it's my turn to pick one of these today. Okay. I've got one here that has two files here that I'm going to play for you. And the first one says, this is the reason that we are patrons of the podcast. So here we go with that. Hi, I'm Jeremiah. And I'm Joanna. And we've been Patreon supporters for five years. And I've been listening to the show since the beginning. One of the reasons I support or we support, I should say, you're welcome, is I would say because the internet algorithm seems to be biased to amplify anger and hate. Having a podcast that exemplifies kindness, curiosity, and authenticity is encouraging and is needed. And you can tell that Matt and Decin are authentic. You can tell that by listening to the entire catalog. They haven't really changed. If anything, the only thing that has changed is that they're no longer timid or apologetic for who they are. But that's because they've built a community that they know they can be authentic with. And I don't do the internet thing, but I'm pretty sure that's really hard to do. It's a massive achievement. They should be super proud of that. And that's something worth supporting. Wow. That's amazing. Well, yeah, I mean, I'm blushing that. If we thought this would be a good idea, but then we didn't think through like, what do we say after? No, right. Because I'm not going to be like, yep, that's us. Super authentic. And if you want to be more authentic like us, like go to Patreon.com slash YouTube questions. I don't know. I guess I'm going to say the same thing that I've said other times that we've heard people saw. This is just that's really, really kind. Then that's one of the kindest things that somebody could say about me. And thank you, Jeremiah and Joanna for saying that and being willing to put your names by ours. That's really cool. I think Jeremiah must have got the wrong message because I distinctly remember telling people to make fun of you. And I didn't feel like that. There's another opportunity because there's another file that I'm going to play for you. And I have the luxury of having this email open in front of me. So I have a little bit of a hint as to what I think is about to happen. Okay. But I have not listened to this next file. It's hitting me cold along with you. And we are going to see what happens. Okay, let's do it. What now? It's music. What? It's freaking awesome. Is that a theme song? This is an incredible bonus. It's amazing. It's the here just bonus. I can even imagine. Was that a bar of clues and test to keep please theme song? Did it end with you screaming? That's an incredible bonus. All right. That's great. It was gritty. It was dirty. It had soul. I didn't see that coming. And I'm weeping. That's a I'm on the other end of the recording. I didn't hear it perfectly. So I'm going to have to go back and re listen to it. But that's more what I was going for. Just you screaming weird things in a microphone over a really cool guitar riff. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I'm sure that's wildly out of balance for you for me because I'm playing the audio from my side. It just sounded magnificent. I mean, that's really well put together. That's I heard a hard like a hard rocking guitar. And then you laughing. That's pretty much all I heard until I heard you say that's an incredible boner. Okay. Yeah, that that was me. But that was a different version of me from another time. That's amazing. Oh my goodness. Well, that was time well spent. I think we pass that along to the patrons, right? They're going to want the Barnacles and testicles theme song. Yeah, I think so. Obviously. Patreon.com slash notum questions. Thank you for writing that. That's amazing. And performing it and for it rocking. And I can't wait for you Destin to hear it on your side like is legitimately good and fun. That's awesome. Yeah. Okay. Jeremiah and Joanna. That was above and beyond. Thank you. That was spectacular. That was funny. That was meaningful. We appreciate it. Thank you to everybody who supports the program. In any way, it just it means the world. Thanks for making this thing happen. It exists because you and we're really grateful. Absolutely. Thank you so much. So I've seen there's this guy on Twitter, Edward Habsburg. Have you seen this guy? No. Is he? Habsburg? Yeah. Ambassador to Hungary to the Holy the Holy See in the sovereign order of Malta. So this guy's like part of the family apparently doesn't have the big jaw. But I've seen him tweeting every once in a while. And it's it's kind of a joke. It's like, oh, if this guy ever wanted to be emperor, he would be emperor, you know, something like that. I never really understood the joke. I hope he doesn't listen to this. I feel I've said some mean things about his family. Mostly their looks. Oh, wait. Land of the free today. Where is he from? Oh, he's in Lazio Rome Rome. Yeah, interesting. So two bullets changed the world. Yep. So what's the takeaway here? Yeah, I've run the math on this a bunch of times and I came to it out and thought, where else could he have put those two bullets that would have had that great an effect on society? I can't think anywhere better. If your objective was to to initiate what ended up happening, well, you don't go shoot the emperor of Austria hungry, that would just put Franz Ferdinand on the throne. That doesn't get anything done. People love Franz Ferdinand. You don't do that. You don't shoot Taft or Wilson presidency in the United States. That doesn't do anything. You just get a vice president and we look back on history and just think, okay, well, then that guy was president. That doesn't do a thing. I mean, what was going on in Russia and China at the time? You know, they're spiraling toward revolution and communism. I guess if you want to end those revolutions, maybe shoot Lenin? I don't know. The point is, if your objective was do away with this old way of thinking, that's a very well aimed shot. So those are probably two of the most consequential bullets ever fired in the world. Yeah, I think so. Wow. That's a lot to think about man. That's heavy. Well, here's one of the big takeaways for me. It's very murky to try to think about how we went from kings and knights and swords and whatnot to what life is like now. And without digging into stuff like this, I think we will tend to imagine that what changed between knights and swords and castles and whatnot. And now is industrialization. We made factories, we made more stuff. Our clothes started to look different. We thought of cars and planes and cell phones and TVs. And that's what changed. Okay, yes. But the whole structure of how we imagine ourselves and our tribe, you know, how we imagine those to come about and where we fit and all of that and how that relates to religion and rights and democracy and how we think of our neighbors. Is somebody I vote against or vote with? All of that stuff is about 100 years old, 100 in change. We're just getting to the place where no one remembers. No one is alive who remembers anything about how the world was pre World War I. Maybe there's some 110 year old person somewhere who can remember being two years old, but nobody remembers this story for me. There's the romantic element. Oh, this couple how sad, you know, you have to live for the children. There's that. But it's an absolute watershed moment in terms of the history of making things how they are for you and me. I saw a map the other day of countries that were led by some form of democracy. We're a Democratic Republic, but I saw the map and I was thinking, Oh, yeah, I wonder how old this this idea is. And America was the oldest one. Come on that. I thought, whoa, you know, everybody makes fun of America for being new. And I remember the guy in Italy saying, yeah, when America was becoming a nation, we were cooking in this kitchen. You know, he was just saying, my kitchen's older than your country. I remember thinking, huh, yeah, we're, we don't know anything. But then I look at the map and I'm like, most countries vote now. Yeah. I mean, there's a few countries that kind of vote, but not really. You know, they, they, they say they are, but they don't. But the even the concept that they at least go through the motions to pretend like they're doing that tells you that it's a good model. Yes. Even if they aren't representative of the people, they still want to pretend they are because they know that's right. Because the government is made to serve the people. Yes. Not the other way around. Yes. So is that what Princeip was getting at? No, I don't, I don't know if Princeip shared values with the French revolutionaries or the American founders or the Bolsheviks. I don't know. Probably somebody does know. I can speak to the practical implications of his decision to pull that trigger twice. But you speaking to the American Revolution and this being more or less the oldest continuous Democratic Republic in existence right now, really what the founders were saying, and this is just so lost on us is we're simply rejecting the ways of the old world. It's a powder keg. It's a time bomb. It's a terrible way to govern. It's a terrible way to live. How would we build something that is proofed against a bunch of these time tested failures? Guys, we have a big enough sample size of European history to know that these things take us off a cliff. It's a terrible idea. So why did the United States jump back into those two world wars? I think there's a lot of altruistic reasons. I happen to really, I mean, I'm somebody who hates war and I agree with us being involved in World War II. That's an incredible exception for me. When I look at wars throughout history for me to be like, that was a good one. And it's good that my people were involved in that one. Generally speaking, I'm just going to be anti-war. This is dumb. This is a stupid political thing. Really, five members of two families should go out in a field and shoot each other and call it good. That's all that really needs to happen here. But they're not going to shed their blood. The Battle of the 100? Yeah, we're either you go. Now we're just going to have six or 700,000 of us do it for them. They're not going to ruin their families. They're far too precious. We'll just destroy our families. And there's new nobility. Of course, it's just moneyed. It's labeled differently. It still exists. So I don't like war. I think a lot of lies force us into those positions. But World War I and World War II, that was sort of us coming along and being like, this was the inevitable thing. We had the luxury of an ocean between us and the rest of this mess. So we were able to get off the train a little quicker than the rest of us from the West. Yeah, here we are to help out. But dude, I don't view the United States as a separate thing. I don't view this as being well, that's European history. That is our history. Dude, I'm a Viking Scott. I'm from that continent. I can tell you the story with the names of the kids and the spouses all the way back to the last remnants of my family that were from England. I know when they came here, I know what day granddaddy got burned. I mean, I know that day, I know the spot, the two by two circle on the ground where he burned to death and died during the reign of King James. That's my story. We are a colony. We're an extension of a pre-existing story, but it's not like a whole new story just starts from scratch when you get here. So for me, I view all of this as being very intertwined. We're just the split off group that was like, hey, if you put enough distance between us and that, you kind of realize you don't really need to do any of this, we could build it differently. We could do it differently. And ultimately, those ideas informed back on our cousins on the other side of the big body of water. Dude, this was fascinating. Thank you for taking me through this. I mean, it's challenging for me. There's a lot of information here. So can you see that some of it's landing with me and some of it I don't understand? Can you see that in me? My body language? Yeah. And that's what, come on, man, it's okay. It would be like somebody explaining the first three Star Wars movies to you. There'd be parts of it. You'd be like, okay, I got that name. And he fought that guy and it turned out that he was his son. Oh, it's crazy. Some of it will stick. Some of the little details won't, but that's what big overviews do. They give you a feel. But if we got to the end of summarizing the story of the first three Star Wars movies, you'd be like, well, there was an empire and it was evil and something had to be done about it. And there wasn't really much of anybody to fight back, but some people didn't. It worked out. It's amazing. Yeah. Well, same thing here. You can see the problem. You can see what it evolved to and you can see where it's at now. This makes me think of Austria differently. How so? Well, I mean, I've always thought of Austria as kind of like Switzerland. Well, it is kind of like Switzerland. I know, but like, I don't know, it just makes me think about what all went down back then. And they were a bigger player on the stage for a long time. You know how with every country you kind of have this like drawer and you kind of throw that. Oh, I'm going to throw them in the quaint mountain drawer. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You know, there's like yodeling in there, you know, yeah, sure. Innsbruck. Yeah. Special pants. That kind of stuff. Yeah. This kind of puts a lot in that drawer now. Like they're a bigger deal. Yeah. They go in the bigger deal drawer. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I agree. Helps me understand and Hitler being from Austria helps me understand some stuff too. Very much a part of this story of Empire versus new nation building and all of that. Yeah. Thanks so much. Do they really appreciate this? Yeah, you meant it was fun. They got some good time.
