I'm excited. There's a thing that happened, and I've read the Wikipedia page on it, and I don't understand it. Right now you could be describing about 11 billion things. I'm interested to have you narrow this down. Okay, so there's a battle that took place online in a video game called Eve Online. And the battle, the Wikipedia page, is called the battle of B-R5RB. And this appears to be up until this point in time, the largest battle that had ever been taken place. Maybe I'm wrong about this in an MMO. Have you ever done an MMO? Yeah, I did a browser-based MMO for a long time ago. It got the best of me. It's probably the last thing I was ever addicted to, but I really enjoyed it. And eventually I cashed out and gave my account to somebody else and have never looked back. But it was fun. It was strategic. It ticked a lot of boxes for me. So you know things about MMOs that I don't know because you describe... Some of the things I read is people do get addicted to these games. It was a little too much in my wheelhouse for me. What do you mean? I really liked it. I mean, so it's a real-time game, the one that I played. It's accelerated, maybe 10x or 100x real-life real-time. And so you got the constraints of time. You get the constraints of the map and space. You have the constraints of resources. You have to build things. You eventually figure out you have to have help. You can't go it alone because you can't be online all the time watching your stuff. You have to have that sort of John Locke agreement. I'm going to give up a little bit of my independence and freedom just a little bit and submit it to you and make obligations to you, my neighbor, so we can watch each other's stuff and sleep at night. You eventually have to make those kind of deals. And eventually military stuff comes into it. You have to manage a military just to keep people from thinking you're an easy target. And then eventually you manage it enough that you're like, well, some other people are an easy target. And you just can't play without mixing it up in that regard. So I like the strategy element and the diplomacy element and all of that stuff. And I got in a little too deep for now. That's pretty funny. This battle, it's a space game. And this thing happened. And apparently this was a historic battle. You can read about it online and you hear people talk about it and it sounds fascinating. I've never played an MMO. But I have found a veteran of this battle. I just wanted to learn about it and have asked this individual if they would be willing to talk to us about it. First they're going to have to explain what the whole thing is and why it matters. Oh, interesting. We're not going to get somebody who does what I do. We're going to get somebody who is there and a veteran of the fight and has some larger perspective, but also the limited perspective in the fog of war from the moment. This is going to be a POV of a veteran. Yeah, they were on the ground except it's space and they like why are we fighting? It's called the battle of B-R5RB. What does that even mean? And I don't think I know this game. It's Eve online. Yes. Yeah, I'm not familiar with the game. I've heard of it. It's apparently a big deal. I mean, our friend Scott Manley plays it and he's a big space YouTuber. Like he's into it. Apparently it's a big deal. And I'm looking at the Wikipedia page and it reads like an actual battle in real life. Huh, there are belligerents, there are commanders. There are types of ships. Can I see it? Can I turn it around? They're casualties. Look at this. So on one side, there's this coalition. That's an actual screenshot of the battle, which looks crazy. So anyway, I just want to talk to this individual. I want to see what's going on because this is a world I don't understand and this is no dumb questions and I just want to I want to expand my world a little bit. People were both coming in cold on this. I have no idea how any of this works or what a battle would look like. So this will be different than asking a veteran of the Gulf War or something like what was it like fighting in Iraq. Because I understand sand and earth and guns and I've got the parameters here. I got nothing. So I'm going to probably jump in a little bit with some real dumb elementary level questions and we'll see how it works. Let's do it. All right. Hey, how are you doing? So your gamer tag is Carnaros. Yeah, my name is Carnaros and game. That's my main character in Yvonne line. At the time of the battle of Btakar, I was the leader of an alliance called L.I.3 Federation based ironically on a podcast. Really? Yeah, podcasts have been popular in Yvonne line for some years. This one was called Lost in Eve and it was run by a gentleman named Jade Cougar. That was his handle. Forgive me. What was sort of abbreviated as L.I.E. or actually they would stylize it as L.I.3 because the E was backwards was sort of a three type thing. So L.I.3 Federation was the official alliance for living in Eve of the Lost in Eve podcast. Anyway, this is fascinating. Yeah. My name is Matt. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I guess I'm the outsider to this conversation coming in completely cold. So would it be okay if I asked you a few questions that are sort of like a five year old who knows nothing? Go for it. All right. Eve online, how long is this game existed? Since May of 2003, so 21 years, it is it's a virtual world, a simulation of living in space in the far, far future. Game has given us a whole bunch of tools with which we can go out and explore and build and destroy and group together and form societies. And we've built our own tools on top of what they gave us as tools. It's different from a video game. Let's say people saw a video game based on a movie and there's all these storylines for you to go through and experience. No, none of that. These aren't a bunch of vignettes that you come up to and go through in the in the order in which the designers expected you to. It's not a storytelling thing. Instead, it's a sandbox where everyone plays together. And what we choose to do is the storyline on the day of the Battle of Btakar. It was a really impressive, exciting, shaking storyline that ended up in the press. Okay. Could you set the stage? I'm a history guy. We haven't met before, but I am fascinated by the history of battle and how all of this business works. So if I'm talking to a group of students and I am trying to explain to them the battle of this is I'm going to tell them where Persia was at before we got cooking. I'm going to tell them where Macedonia was at, where the leaders heads are at, where we're at in the larger campaign. Who's the more powerful resources? I've been backed up a little bit before that for us. Just slightly earlier. Always works in that example. Everyone knows that there's one planet and it rotates 24 hours and that kind of thing. In this game, it's relevant to explain that again, because there's one world that we all participate in. It rotates 24 hours a day. The game is going, whether you're playing or not, when you get up in the morning, you can choose to log in, check on things or go to work or whatever you do. When you get up work and you can log in and play that evening hours, we call prime, prime time for your time zone. So let's say you live in New York. When you get home from work five or six in the afternoon, that starts the US East Coast prime. The world is rotating. When you get tired and have to go to bed that night, the world keeps going without you. Next time you wake up, you might find, check your messages to see what happened while you were gone. This is a daily thing. People who own a piece of space in this game, protect it 24 hours a day. You have to have friends, ideally friends in multiple time zones or allies or something, because people will come in and make a mess of your front yard if you go to sleep at night. Just put it that way. What time zone are you in? A lot of times it doesn't even matter. If you run an alliance in ETH, you have to pay attention to it at least 16 hours a day. That's life. I happened for most of this to be based in California, but my members know that I get up early in the morning. I turn off my comms at night for a few hours, but other than that, I'm connected and I'm managing a space empire. Do they compensate you to do that? There are 500 people relying on me to help take care of them. Although it was a little smaller at the time of the Battle of BTechArts, probably 2000. Members of my organization. So a question, you're saying the Battle of BTechR? What does the tech mean? Because when I look at it on the Wikipedia page, it's B-R5RB. I don't know why hyphens are spelled out with are called a tack in this game. It's been this way since before I started playing it. There are certain things that people do. Partly, some of them are to be clearer for people who don't speak English as their best language. For example, if there were a Z in the name, we usually call it by the British pronunciation of Z, just in those names. Because when it's just a string of letters and digits, you have so little context to go by that you are required to do the best you can with spelling things out. I'm a little bit lucky that I have a fairly clear voice and an accident in English that is fairly understandable to people. It can get trickier if you have a stronger accent. So BTechArts was then how we call it the Battle of BTechArts. I'll go to the call it for the Battle of BTechArts 5RB. The name of the solar system where it took place was B-R5RB, spoken as BTechArts. There were a group of people who owned that system and controlled it. There was a station in that solar system that was a regional hub of activity. People stored ships there. People went there and did things and got that. People got together there and had activities together. There were other places around where people were also having activities. That one was a medium-sized one that mattered at the time in that region of space. The people who lived there were part of a larger coalition of other groups that were allied to each other. And in times of war, they would call each other up and say, hey, we're being attacked. Can you help us? Or hey, we're going to go hit those guys over there. Do you want to come with us? Is there a name for that coalition? Okay. Yeah. The group that ran that system were called pandemic legion. No reference to the much, much later COVID pandemic that happened. These guys have been in existence with that selected name for well over 10 years by the time COVID hit. So that's just ignore that for a moment. They're a cool group. Their symbol is a bacterial phase. It's just they're talented. They're smart. They happen to be our enemies. Oh, so they, oh wait, I'm starting to understand. So they owned BTACR. They had a territorial claim unit established in the system. What is that? You may think of it as a flag planted on an island saying we on this island. This is part of our country. I don't want to hear any. One time people did things like that for the flag. A territorial claim unit is a computer sitting in space, sending out a signal telling everyone this solar system is a part of the sovereignty claim of pandemic legion. They can hear a certain amount of what happens in this system automatically through this territorial playing unit. And if you try anything here, just assume they're going to come and have an opinion on the subject. So pandemic legion had friends in multiple time zones for reasons that should be clearer to you now that you understand the rhythm of this world. Okay. One other thing to tell you, this game is 21 years old. One of the, it was a building of this game back in the day was an astounding technical feat to have everyone in the universe be able to participate on one server or cluster at the same time was a big deal. One of the things they had to give up in the trade offs of building it was that every day at some point in the day, they have to turn off the damn machine and restart it and run a cleanup script on it to fix a bunch of things. This is old tech. Remember when people use floppy disks? Yeah. It was very hard to change your mind on something like this after you've built 21 years of additional game on top of this simulation. Okay. Mind it, every day at a certain time there's a downtime cycle. Does everyone know that at what time the time cycle is going to end? What they did is when they set up the game, they picked what would be the least busy time of the clock to do this. So it's basically during Australian Prime and the Australians are used to, the game will shut down for at that time about 15 minutes every day right in the middle of their prime playing time. So they come home from work, they do a bidding game, they log off the game refreshes, they log back in and they can finish what they're doing. They're used to it. Everyone else gets it easy. The Europeans, the Americans, we're all spoiled rotten and don't have that happening in the middle of our day. On this particular day in the battle where the battle of BTECR happened, what year is this? This is the 2014, January 28th. And I've just got to say as a side note, this is the weirdest wild card I have ever heard of for a battle. Just the idea of, well, the two sides amassed for war and Hannibal is at the gates of Rome, but then Earth shut down for 15 minutes. And they just all had to wait for Earth to restart. It's just I've never thought of this before. Yeah. The company has improved it down to something like on sub five minutes, but it's still a suspension of disbelief jarring thing that happens and humans can get accustomed to a lot of things. They're accustomed to this at this point. But someday I expect they'll get rid of it somehow. It will be a crazy, full rewrite to do it. That is my estimation. Let's get out of the weeds for a second. Early in the morning of January 28th of 2014. By early, I mean Russian prime. What has happened is something went wrong with the automatic payment system that pandemic Legion had associated for the monthly sovereignty bill cost associated with running that beacon in space called the territorial claim unit. In order to hold that territory, you have to pay a certain amount of interstellar credits to the game once a month. If you like, you can pay it manually. If you don't like, you can connect it to a particular wallet and it will take money out of the wallet and it can have multiple wallets that it can go to if the first one runs dry for some reason. That doesn't sound like fun, but there are people who enjoy the mechanics of managing the financial responsibilities of a large organization. If you've got 150 solar systems and you're paying sovereignty bills on each of them and they were each acquired on a different day and they have a different 30 day cycle. It's good to just connect the whole thing to an automatic wallet. The guy who was in charge of that wallet on that day and doing all that stuff claims that there was a software glitch. It was all hooked up for automatic payment. There was money in the wallet. He might be right. Who was it? If it ever happened that particular day, the payment did not go through. The sovereignty claim canceled. The territorial claim unit exploded. The map suddenly showed that as a neutral territory available for claim by anyone who cared to come and do that. There are a lot of really talented, very high awareness players in Russian time zone who will notice if you make a mistake that big on a piece of territory that valuable. And they did. These particular players are not the cautiously planned and advanced set up all your logistics carefully. Get your supply chain in order, form up all your people and move deliberately into a piece of territory. Now, these are the people who are act first come up with a narrative line and a set of excuses later, that type. They quickly scrambled a bunch of ships, sent them to BTEC R5RB, and each tried to drop their own territorial claim unit to get it to online first to claim that system out from under pandemic Legion. It takes, I think at that time, it was eight hours to successfully online such a unit. Plenty of time for a lot of people to try to put one up and a lot of ammunition to be expended. So people started coming. These players are well organized and they have excellent communication systems and they can get the word out to thousands of players in seconds. So various communication tools lit up that day and things started happening. Now keep in mind Europe's all at work. America's asleep. How long are the travel times? Is it like warp speed is portrayed in Star Trek or like hyperspace and Star Wars? That depends. Okay. It depends how you're getting there. It depends what kind of ship you're flying. Some ships in general, the larger the ship, the slower the travel time in even line. The smaller the ship, the faster and more responsive it flies. However, you're going to put a territorial claim unit in space. That's not a small object. That computer that you're placing in space has a small space station that holds it there and takes care of it. It's not small. So you can't do it in a tiny fast ship. You need a little bit larger medium sized ship to move it there. Anyway, and you're going to need some protection for it. So you have to form up a fleet. Anyway, people started forming fleets. Their spy networks out. People saw each other forming fleets and they formed fleets. And then people saw the other guys forming and said, hold their friends and said, we need help. We're going to lose this system if we can't get help. People started pouring in and started forming up and making their way. And it escalated from medium sized ships that can carry a territorial claim unit and support crews for them to capital sized ships and super capital class ships all the way up to the largest ships that were currently in existence in this game. Can you give me any kind of context of scale or cost on these? Yes. I'm not prepared with an image right now, but it's okay. It's a beautiful image that I could show you. But it's something I think an avatar class Titan like I was flying is something like 14 kilometers in length. I'm sorry. You were flying a Titan in this battle? Yes. I was flying an avatar class Titan one in this battle. I had paid a lot of money for it. I don't want to say it. Actual money. Okay. Oh, there's somebody in the room. You can't say that loud. That's fine. That's really good. So let me ask you this. So this territorial claim unit that we're going to put in this position, is this going to be the territorial claim of Carnaros? No, no, no, no, no, no. These are these have to do with what with the alliance that's placing it. Hinemically, Jim is an alliance of corporations and Eve and they forgot to make the game. The alliance level can place a TCU a territorial claim. So you keep in mind, America's asleep. Europe is at work. It's Russian prime. So no, very few Americans have any idea this is happening. These are Russians and Russians or in a few Eastern Europeans that are hurrying to the system to go drop multiple territorial claim units. For what alliance? Multiple of them. This is before I got there. By the time I wake up and I arrive at this battle, no one cares about the stupid TCU's. They're there to shoot each other's Titans. The TCU is just roughly speaking a $5 piece of equipment in this world. Just to give you a rough approximation in our currency in America. A Titan is somewhere around like maybe $1,500. Whoa. What? They were designed to be built by a group of people, not one person by themselves. It's a lot of work. But you had one. To build a Titan. And I had one. And I had taken me, I had been playing this game for five years by the time I had my first Titan, this Titan and took it to the things, my first Titan. Today I've been playing for 14 years and I have four others. But that one's done. But you know, yeah. So it's just a different world now. How many Titans showed up? A lot. Scores and scores of them. Over a hundred. Why do you have a Titan? And is it a big deal that Titans showed up? I don't understand. You don't escalate with them. You don't risk them if you think you're going to lose it because they're very hard to replace. Just the build time is three months. And that's assuming someone handed you all of the materials and said, here you go, build yourself a Titan. Seeing the resources together to build this, unless you're independently wealthy, it's a lot. No, you don't spend these lightly. One doesn't do that. And that's the point of view of an American. If you live in one of these countries where the standards of living in the average wage is much lower like Eastern Europe or Russia, a Titan is like a $10,000 spaceship. Now these people, they don't have backups. If they lose it, they lose it. This does not respond somewhere like some other game. If you risk this thing, if you undock it and risk it in combat, that's real risk. I'm not in a position to pay $10,000 for an actual spaceship right now. That's crazy money. Yeah. So why did you do it? Why did you decide to take your Titan into BTACR? It's Russian Prime. Americans asleep. Let me back up a little bit. Okay. Now I wake up in the morning. I look at my space empire and I look at what's going on. And one of the first things I see is a dead Titan on the killboard. What? Those are rare occurrences. So I'm watching what happens and I'm asking my friends what's going on. There's a battle in BTACR 5RB. Forces have moved there. Apparently, sovereignty bill didn't get paid, soft dropped, territorial claim, and it exploded, rushed to get there. Our guys got there quickly. Their guys are escalating too. Oh, okay. Second Titan appears on the killboard. I'm poking my friends at CCP who work there. CCP manifest. I'm saying, did you see this? Wake up. Smell the coffee. Something's happening. Go take a look at your game. In the meantime, I work for a different company in California called at that time, Sony Online Entertainment. Different game. I go into work. The third Titan has fallen now. I go into work in the morning. I sit on exec row there in the company. Never mind what I do. I tell them, guys, massive Titan battle. They're like, oh, wow. Keep us posted. I'm watching things happening. I think that's when the third Titan falls and I tell them third Titan falls. CEO says to me, go home. Take the rest of the day off. That's a good boss. That's a good boss. Who lose your Titan this time? I go, okay. So I go home 10 in the morning, 10 o'clock in the morning. I get in my Titan and I support Aeon. I was an Avatar class Titan and as an Aeon support ship. I got in the fleet and they had sinosurial beacons ready for me to navigate my way to this fight and they had protection set up along the way. There are so many fleet set up. I can't tell you with military commanders running each one and it's complicated and in layers, but I moved in. Well, all the right stuff. I got into position. The Titans were put into one group. They had a specific target caller that would coordinate their massive doomsday weapons. You can only fire it once every 10 minutes, but the game was moving so slowly because there were so many people packed into one system that it was not intended to hold that many. That once every 10 minutes turned into once an hour, once per hour, I was able to press my doomsday weapon on one target. I still had other in this case, an Avatar class Titan has lasers that they can use it long range also and I was using them in between, but the doomsday is the main thing. So firing at once a weapon, we had a target caller who would say put an X in chat. If you were ready to fire it, okay, when it got to 100 or whatever the number was 28 or I can't remember what number of doomsday's they would wake for it. They say, okay, this group ready. Here's your target fire and that one other one will go down. Another one was trading back and forth. So you had a person directing fire for effect and it's going on for hours and it's freaking exhausting. Let me explain to you, you're wagering a thousand dollars ship in a battle with huge numbers on all sides. You don't know who's going to be targeted next. Your hands are shaking when you get selected as a target. When you see them all lighting up and red and incoming fire coming to you, your body shakes. It's not like a normal video game. This is a level of intensity like you wouldn't believe. Their team is rotating out fleet commanders every hour or two because they're getting tired and they need a break and someone else comes on. We had famous people. Lazarus Tellraven, you need to get him on your show one sometime. Pro God legend came on for what? No, Elon Knight. There was some famous names in this game that came on and target called for a while for us and where it was hardcore. This went on. I remember I joined 10 AM my time. This went on until almost three o'clock in the morning for me all day, all night. At just before three o'clock in the morning, I knew downtime was coming. That horrible cycle I told you about. And I knew I did not want my avatar tightened sitting in BTECR 5 space when downtime came. So I had to calculate when I could take my last shot such that I could afterwards jump my ship. I'd have enough power left in my capacitor to be able to jump my ship out of that system to a different system nearby and get safe inside the force field of a tower on a moon. I had a place I'll prepared. I knew where I needed to go. I had enough fuel. I just needed to time everything right. And at five minutes to three in the morning, I jumped out and then I moved my ship inside the protective field and logged off just in time for three o'clock in the morning. How many ships were you able to take down? I was able to kill 15 Titans, two super carriers, four carriers and six dreadnoughts in the space of time between 10 a.m. and three a.m. How do you remember that? There is a website that we call ZKillboard.com that tracks recorded deaths and who contributed and such. I don't remember that kind of thing. Details personally, I went and looked it up this afternoon when I was asked if I might want to come on and say a few words. Wow. ZKillboard. Is that a big deal? Like is that how many Titans have you killed since then? Let's put it this way. It's a rare day when a Titan dies. That's like one of the first times in any times that there have been 15 Titans dead in one day. It actually was a lot larger number than that. That's a big deal. Yes, that's a big deal. I was only one out of like 100 Titans on our side shooting. So I couldn't get on every kill. There were a lot more dying. What would have happened if you hadn't made it out of there before 3 a.m. and you would still been in combat during the downtime? Well, that means I no longer have the opportunity of logging in in a safe space to get my bearings in the game. I have to log in in the middle of a war zone afterwards. That means I have to get people I trust to be watching at that side. We have to be in control of the grid iron, so to speak, in control of the field when I do that. Field is such a two dimensional concept. It's in a three dimensional space. But you don't risk that valuable a ship by just blindly logging in at any time. You have no idea if you just crashed a party of hostels. They will drop anything they're doing to kill a Titan. You are the largest piece of bait out there. Okay. We'll follow up question to that. Can you describe the way your fleet was arrayed? Because it's three dimensional space. That's very different than how I think of say the Battle of Gettysburg. I can draw the line of the Battle of Gettysburg right down to the little hook at Little Round Top. I understand this in an X and Y, but it's hard for me to picture how you would array this fleet when you add a Z chord. How did that work? Yeah. A lot of times in a battle in the Ebon line, there is a station or an object in space or a captured, a trapped ship or something that is the focus of the battle. Everything is trying to fight position for a good relative positioning around that focus. In this particular case, that was less the case because the territorial claim units that were onlineing out wherever were popping up wherever in various parts of the system. But the first time and the groups were arriving in various parts of the system, the first time that engaged with each other, though, that created now a nexus of where everyone else wanted to get to. The first time there's an engagement because one of the idiosyncrasies of a Titan is in order to fire that massive doomsday weapon that is so powerful in a large fleet battle like this, you have to immobilize your ship for a period of time. Part of the game design trade-offs is I risk something by firing this powerful thing. I'm saying, I can't go anywhere. I can't fly through space and I can't jump out with my jump drive. I can't go anywhere. I'm going to sit right here until my timer runs off. Then I have an opportunity to either fire it again and be stuck again or leave. That's all. By the time I woke up, joined the fleet, came home from work, joined the fleet, battle lines had been set up in places. That happened before I got to the party, so to speak. On the end of the train, on US time zone, so to speak, our fleet commanders had little small moving vessels in the area moving around looking at the layout of the situation and they're calling back targets to the group. Everyone's got a headset on. They're calling back targets. They picked spots and said, I want a recon ship to come to me here, work to me, stop right here, decloque, light your beacon. That would give us the chance for all the big ships to lock onto that navigation beacon, jump in from outside and be in a good position for the fight in front of us. That make any sense? Hard to say this. What you're describing is a very dynamic, complex, multifaceted, spread out battlefield scallops. Moving in slow motion at one sixth speed because of the server constraints. Wow. So you were in the Titan. Does that mean other players decided to protect you? They made it their job to protect you? There were protectors like that in fleets for several jumps even to get to BTECR5R. And then once we're inside, there was a group in sub-capital ships surrounding us, protecting us from anyone coming over and trying to do something stupid to our Titans. Secondly, a lot of us brought a smaller ship buddy with us. So I had an Aeon class super carrier with me. I might have had two actually, but I had, I'm there. The Aeon and the Avatar burn are both built by the same company in the lore of the game. And they use the same type of fuel. So their fuel is compatible with each other. So one of the things I could do was hairy extra fuel in my super carrier, because it costs like a hundred thousand helium isotopes every time I want to fire the doomsday weapon. And I just fired it 15 times. That's 1.5 million helium isotopes. The same thing I also need if I'm going to move my ship by jumping out of the system. So do I want to trap myself here? No, I'm not dumb. So I'm calculating all these things. I'm keeping the place in the battle where I was placed, keeping an eye on my protectors. I'm refueling myself for my super carriers when I can. And I'm transferring fuel into my system in between shots. And then those super carriers have fighters that they can send out. So I'm dealing with anything that comes near me with those fighters if I can. Unfortunately, they're really hard to use in slow motion in that level of battle. You know how in a loud room your partner can choose to hear the parts they want to hear of the conversation? Yeah, like how much your ship costs. Yeah. In a large battle in Eve, the server can occasionally forget some of the commands that come out. For whatever reason, it prioritizes some commands above others. Your ability to manipulate a smaller ship like a drone or a fighter craft is for some reason fairly suppressed in the noise of a giant fleet battle. So you can't really rely on it. The thing that hears best are doomsday weapons. So those become more powerful than they even should be in the context of a massive struggling server battle. So one question I have is you said to even get to BTACR, you had to have basically fighter escort, but at the carrier level, all the way to BTACR. I had to have support at locations of I would jump to one place and I needed protection. And then I would jump to another piece and I needed protection. So some people that you talk to, if you're going to interview people about BTACR and the fight there, some people will say, I was in the battle, but I wasn't in a system. And by the means they were probably one of the protection fleets, one jump out to help us get our Titans in or. Yeah, with logistical support to it's massive. Thousands and thousands of people on either side. Wow. But keeping that movement open behind the lines. I mean, the ancients knew you had to do that. And it's not free movement behind the lines like it is in a cheap phone video game. This game sophisticated understands that those vulnerabilities must exist. This is complex stuff, man. And some of the people running these fleets are military leaders in real life. Really? And some of them aren't, but that's only because their governments are idiots and don't realize what they have. Or they would ask that person to go and take it or because they're freaking great. For what nation are these people, military leaders? All of them. This is an international game, sir. Do they ever fight in real life? Well, let's put it this way. Today in Eve Online, which I still play every day, I'm a leader of a small corporation of a little over like 100 people. But that 100 people, about half of them are either Russian or Ukrainian, which you might realize presents some challenges. Okay. So that you have Russians and Ukrainians in the same group. They're allied together fighting under you. Yeah. So I have Russians and Ukrainians and English speakers on my team. And I have Russian speakers and English speakers on my leadership team. And we coordinate them all. And we agree to set aside what's happening in real life. And keep this space as a non-political place where we can interact. In real life, they do that also in things like the Olympic Games and stuff. They try to set aside politics. It doesn't always work. I remember Munich in the 1970s. You know, there are times it doesn't work. But at least people make an effort to keep the Olympic Games as a non-politics zone. You with me? This game, we try to do that well as well. Now, you can set up your own society in space in the future as part of this game. Absolutely. You can say, where are all Ukrainians? Blabbo, Ukrainian, or however you say it. We do everything together as a team and we don't recruit anyone else. You could do that in the game. You're limited to a time zone. But at least everyone speaks Ukrainian. I mean, there's some benefits to it. That's just a hypothetical. In my group, we are a mixed group. We're friends. We have flown together in a previously in a large group. And we all liked each other. And when the group split up, we 100 stepped together and said, let's all go do our own thing. We'll become the Night Watchmen. Is that what you call yourselves? The Night Watchmen? Is that a reference to Martin? No. Just coincidental. Okay. So probably basketball of all the sports I play is the one where if I play an opponent, I can learn things about them as a person and they learn things about me based on decisions they make on the floor, how they respond to adversity, their first choice of what to do with the ball and given situations, their willingness to do the dirty work or stay outside. You learn about a human playing basketball. You do. Likewise, when I study commanders, the great commanders of history, I learn about their personality through their command decisions under various types of pressure. Is the detail in this game sufficient that you have been able to observe command tendencies on people you don't know through their decisions on the battlefield? Yes. Or to accurately predict command decisions of people you do know well, but that you haven't seen yet on the battlefield? Yes. And the people who are fleet commanders habitually on our side are often the best at watching someone else's fleet commanders and seeing patterns in their tactical and strategic decisions and drawing inferences about the future. So if, for example, we get a report that says hunting deity is forming a fleet and he's bringing in the executive and av issues as the main fleet because our scouts there are watching them undock and go and get on a Titan to be bridged. You know, we can see that. Then we get a report back. Our FCS, our fleet commanders can look at that and go, I have a good idea what he's going to do with it and how he'll act once he arrives on the battle grid. So I will choose this ship that's slightly smaller and more maneuverable and I'll go and fight him. They'll put together a plan like that. Or I will choose this other ship that has much longer range and I'll stay back out of their range and I'll fight sniper style from a distance. Or, you know, there's all kinds of things like that. But if they look at the fleet, we do have a couple of fleet commanders that are exceptionally difficult to see their patterns because they're so unpredictable. Mr. V. Super military mine. Okay, so I'm just thinking about the stakes of this. And if it's a detailed enough game that you can observe command decisions, tendencies, what strikes fear into a person's heart when they'll pull back when they'll engage, how they pick the moment of engagement, all of this stuff. And you don't have anonymity and you just know, well, this is Admiral so-and-so and he commands the fleet of this nation in earth. And this over here is General so-and-so and he commands the Marines of this nation on earth. It would actually be bad if they knew each other's names and knew who each other were because theoretically, if you got familiar enough with those tendencies, it could have real world consequences should the two ever meet. I do believe that has happened in the history and on a number of occasions. Such as the game. Oh, okay. Talking about the real world that has, I believe that has happened at times in the real world where people got to know each other a little too well. Wow. Magneto and Xavier. And if it's possible to keep your perspective even as you get to know people, for example, my closest neighbor to where I live in real life who plays even online is a famous player for the other side. I won't mention her name at the moment, but she and I and her husband will occasionally go have dinner. It's okay. My guys know her guys know. We're not going to get on the same side in a battle. We don't think less of each other. We can still be friends. I know that doesn't sound very enlightening, but no, it's a big deal. So this is a monthly player meetups in Los Angeles and hang out and have beer. She doesn't drink, but we'll hang out. I'll have a beer. This is fascinating. I would like to know what happened in BTECR, but what was the outcome of the battle and how did it change the game. My understanding is at the time, this was the largest battle ever. Most expensive, most dead titans, it was shocking. But what happened was we're watching the battles trade offs. They fired on our guy. He died. We fired on their guy. He died back and forth, back and forth. They were volleys each way, almost like a tennis match. And something was dying on each side in slow motion. One six speed type thing. And this is happening. Then, and while that's happening, both sides are going to be shoving as many men into the biggest ships as they can and getting them to the battle. And by men, I mean men and women. Sorry. So people are getting there as fast as they can, more men than women as it happens. But the nature of this kind of game, people are showing up rapidly. Risking their ships. The Russians are losing their ships first because of time zones and when this started. The Europeans are getting off work. They're pouring in. The Europeans are there. Your ships are dying. Ships are dying. The Russians are tired, but staying up now. Because it's bedtime, but they can't leave their ship because it's in space. And you can't walk away from your $10,000 spaceship and just go to bed. That's not an option. Don't kid yourself. And you're shaking with adrenaline. The Americans now, the earth is rotating. The Americans are waking up. A moment comes where two of their titans died before one of ours did. Interesting. Let's watch carefully for the next 15, 20 minutes, 30 minutes and see how that goes. Okay, they just lost two again and we lost one momentum shifting. You guys, we got this. That moment comes. We're pouring in people. Propaganda and nerve play a role in a battle like this. When you see that happen, your propaganda team goes out to public chat areas like Reddit or the official forums or somewhere else discord and they say, oh, did you see that? They're falling behind. That doesn't look good. Then there are next Americans who get off work. Look at that. So I want to risk my Titan. I don't know. It's freaking expensive. It's going to take me six months to replace it. Even if I replace it quickly. I don't know. Does my alliance have enough money to replace it for me? I don't think so. I'm scared. So then only 50% as many people jump in with nerve to support their team as they could have. On the pandemic, Legion? And their allies. So they slow down on getting new folks coming in. And in the meantime, ours are still coming in. That's how a battle like that shifts. At the end of the night, three o'clock is going to be over. It doesn't matter what you do. It's not going to be over early. And no matter what you do, it's going to stop at that point. Because whoever's losing is not going to log back in after the server cycles. That's how it happens. So then afterwards, everyone sits down around a table, drinks a cup of coffee, takes a deep breath and says, all right, let's see what the totals were like. You got the kill board there chugging through trying to track the massive losses that it's never had to calculate that many before. But we can see a lot. And when you put it down and we go, okay, the fleet commander can look at his fleet and go, I had 256 Titans in this fleet. That's not the number. But right now, I can see I have 75. So that meant I lost 100 and something of them. They can see that even before the kill board tells them the numbers. That's a real world house in value. Yes. Old thinking is that physical items are worth more than digital items. But that's not always going to be the truth. Intellectual property rights can be worth more. Sure. Seems like that would be something you would understand in your line of work. Yes. Yeah. There are a lot of things out there that don't have a physical component. I'm shaking my desk. That's a bad idea. There are a lot of things in life that are not physical that are still valuable. Yeah. Yes. I'm looking at the casualties. Yeah, this was this was a big battle. Yes, sir. Jockingly big. In the aftermath, what they had to do is we camped them into that station with hostile ships around it so that they could not they could not undock to extract assets and they couldn't dock ships. They just couldn't I use that structure for a while. So did they have to eventually negotiate out? Yes. After a while, the leader of pandemic Legion made a deal with the leader of gunswarm. So Manfred Sidious from pandemic Legion? I think it was I think it was the least Randolph that made the deal. But it wasn't Manfred. Maybe it was Manny made a deal with the Matani, which was the name of the leader of gunswarm. And I think it was like 30 days after the battle. They unlocked it and said, go ahead and extract your stuff. And we pulled back and left. Their side did this thing where they did they put together a big effort to replace the lost Titans. Titans are strategic value in this game. They are necessary to project power and influence over large spaces. And anyway, they did a combination of an accelerated build program sharing inputs to coordinate things. And they also went back to former players and said, Hey, you're not playing right now. Can we borrow your Titan now to restore our power and we'll replace it to you later when you want to play again? That's brilliant. It wasn't my idea that enemies did that. But yeah, it worked really well. They were able to replace, you know, at least a couple dozen of them that way by just calling up their old friends who logged in enough to give them the Titan and said, Okay, you owe me one. You know, when how those were all replaced, I don't know, someone probably tracked him in a spreadsheet. Even online, everyone has a spreadsheet open on the side tracking all kinds of stuff. So yeah, this is the way. So your side, which is L. I. E. Life in Eve. That was your small alliance. And you were rolled into the larger alliance, which was called no, no, my side was named by the coalition, not by my group. At that time, it had a rather crass, crass name. We call it the CFC. Okay. Never mind what it stood for. We've been rebranded since then to the Imperium. But our side was called the CFC. And I was, you know, a medium-sized player in that complex world, not a big one. So it's my understanding that after the battle, I would assume since that beacon or the sovereignty beacon, is that what it was called? Territorial claim unit online and it flipped sides. But you know, I can't remember which side even claimed it. I could look it up. But that's what ultimately like right now in BTAC are, who has the territory? Thank you. One second. One second. Luckily, the tools that have been built for this stuff are amazing. And I can go look it up. So on January, 2014, January, razor alliance got it. So that's one of the alliances on our side, Took it. Got it. Took it for several months before they gave it back. Northern coalition, one of the big ones on the pandemic Legion side, they took it back in April of that year. By force? I don't know if it were diplomacy or force at the time. I don't know. I don't remember. But it wasn't a major battle like this. So my understanding is right now in BTAC are there's a large memorial to the battle. Is that true? There is a memorial to the battle there. The company recognized what the players did and chose to memorialize it. It already has a big place in our collective memories, regardless of which side of the battle you were on. It made an impact on you. But there are new people coming into the game who, you know, they weren't around, they hear the stories of it later. They can go to that place and they can find a memorial that looks like a group of destroyed, tightened holes in a cluster with a plaque there that you can read. Whether it's a large memorial or not is a value judgment on your side. But there is a memorial. Yes. If you participated in the battle, it has a poignancy to it. I don't know what it's like for someone who just hears about it later. How much credibility do you get when you meet or hang out with e-online players and you get to say I was there? You don't get any like major reputation boost or something like that. What you get is if the other person was in the battle too, you get a bond with them that says, I remember it too. And, you know, in some ways, it doesn't matter if they're on your side or the other side. Regardless of that, it still feels like a bond. They say that history is written by the winners or at least that is a saying that sometimes gets repeated. I suppose in support of that idea is that a lot of the people who lost die and they don't get a voice anymore. They don't get to write an account. They're buried on the battlefield. But here nobody died. So how does this history get recorded and how does the fact that everyone who lost is still alive and still has a keyboard and still has memories and can still give their take on it? How does that make the telling of the story and the remembering of the story unique? This is an unusual game in that regard, you know, other regards as well. But in that regard, this is unusual because we have historians who write history books about this game. There's a gentleman named Andrew Groen, G-R-O-E-M, who has written, I think you've had him on the show. He's written Empires of E, Volume 1 and 2. Volume 2 had a multi-sided recount of this battle. He interviewed people on multiple sides. He didn't interview me. I was one of the big wigs. I just ran a small alliance and I brought my ship type of thing. But there were more important people, target collars, strategic decision makers, etc. Haya, who he talked to on both sides. If you want to dive deeper into BTECR, it's a deep subject and you could hear a lot more interesting stuff than from talking to me. Wow. Thank you so much for your time, Carnaros. I guess we're going to just keep you at your gamer tag or would you like people to know who you actually are? If they want to know who I am, they know me. That's the spirit. That's awesome. Carnaros, how do you spell your gamer tag? C-A-R-N-E-R-O-S, Carnaros. Carnaros. The first wine growing region in the United States to get officially designated with an AVA tag, American Viticultural Area. Carnaros District just on the north shore of the San Francisco Bay. Thank you so much, Carnaros. We appreciate your time. Very much. Thank you. Have a good day. This episode of Notum Questions is sponsored by the patrons of the program who voluntarily support this show because they want to thank you to all of you. We affectionately call the patrons of the program the winged as SARS because you all arrived in our hour of need and we really are truly grateful this thing wouldn't happen without you. And as a way of saying thanks with this episode, there's a little bit of bonus content that we're sharing with all the patrons who support at any level. And that is an interview with Scott Manley of the YouTube channel, Scott Manley, who was a part of the battle we are discussing in this episode. And we will have that published over at patreon.com slash notum questions as a way of saying thanks to everybody who supports. All right. Thanks again to all of the winged to SARS who support the program and thanks to all of you who might consider it. Back to the conversation. The extra parameters are mind-boggling to me because I have thought about this kind of stuff since I was 18 years old and I had my first military history and strategy class in undergrad and I fell in love with it and I just kept taking classes and I kept reading. There's always wild cards in any given battle, but they're all within the boundaries of earth physics. And so to have these extra wild cards like when people come online, I mean, that's just wild. And did you notice that the prime rotation followed the exact order of when people got into the war in World War II? No, I didn't know the heat was on Russia. The heat was in Europe. Then the United States got involved. It was kind of crazy the way that rotated through. So taking different shifts. I've never considered that variable. I mean, you think about the night's watch and keeping tabs on things while people are sleeping, but this is different. And then the idea of that server reset that's just baked in and you'd have to be an idiot to leave your vessel in harm's way and in the battle when you know that is coming up. It really is. It's just like earth pausing and then earth and reality is going to unpause and something is going to happen when it unposes. Maybe there's not precision in when the unpause happens. I have no idea how that detail plays out. Carnaros made it very clear. You'd have to be an idiot to leave your vessels in combat during the reset. I mean, that's completely different. Everybody has this mental picture of how long it takes to walk a certain distance, to charge or run a certain distance. You can kind of guess even if you've never ridden a horse, how long it would take to ride a horse a certain distance to drive a car to fly a plane. You can picture all of that. You can imagine what combat would be like and how quickly you could get you or other forces marshaled to go and fight. I can't picture this at all. I don't know how far everybody's coming from. How long does it take? I mean, the best thing I can imagine is just the way it looks like when ships come out of hyperspace and Star Wars and say, well, there's a whole battle here and more ships just magically appeared out of space. But what's so interesting about that is in order to get to BTACR, they had to go through a different, I guess, they said beacons. So they had to illuminate the path to BTACR through other solar systems. And they said there were like tangential battles happening in those solar systems because every beacon is a vulnerability. Yeah. Yeah. And so they realized, okay, I've got to go from A to B to so it's like an onion. So like the battle is happening at the center of the onion and then each layer going out, I imagine there's more space you have to cover unless there was just one line of beacons laid out. But even then if you're the enemy and you can take control of one beacon, you've effectively blown up the pipeline and then that ratio that he was talking about when it finally flipped to two to one. It's like Sherman twisting the railroad ties. Sherman bow tie. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That was complex. Did you see the fire in his eyes? Yeah, he meant that. He did. He sounded like an old veteran who had a huge battle. I mean, guys seen a lot of skirmishes, a lot of battles, but that's the one that stands out to him. It's from relatively early in his career, like you're probably two of his military career in EVE Online. And then we got to sit and just hear the war story from somebody who was there. How old would you say Coroneras is late 60s? You think mid 60s? His brain was sharp as a tack. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's a zoom call on a tiny screen across the room. So I'm not the best person to ask. How old did you think he was? I'd say right at 60, maybe. Okay, that could be. Maybe. I don't know. His mind sounded very young. Very young, which is amazing. Gosh, that was awesome. Those are the things that jump off the page for me. There's probably more. What about you? It's fascinating. The parallels, like once you said, it's not unlike the Skittles game that you were talking about in one of the earlier episodes that we did. Once you limit the map and you have certain resources in certain locations, things naturally happen. I was reading where the pandemic Legion, they assembled in what they're called, they called the wrecking ball formation. And so that was more of a defensive position. And then they tried to put their ships on the outside and they had this big, like, just a massment of ships in one sphere. I mean, things are just going to happen. You're going to stumble onto certain things that you do as a fleet commander. I just think it was fascinating. They instantly realized, okay, we have to coordinate our fire. It's artillery, right? Which isn't unlike lobbing arrows at each other when you're, that's what killed Saul, right? Was Saul taken out in the Bible with an arrow? Injured. Injured. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He injured. He died a different way. So Saul, he just ran himself through it, right? Yeah, he did. So it's fascinating to see that once you limit resources in a certain way, battle happens in a, I don't know how to say it, there's prescribed rules that once you put them in place, these procedural things happen so that you have an emergent behavior of war. Just going to happen every time. It has fascinating. Yeah, my mind goes back to an episode I knew as well. The one about if you restarted the world 100 times, this years ago, you and I had this conversation. I won't be offended if you don't remember. But I think it was a whole episode where we're like, well, what are the things that if you started the world 100 times over would happen 100 times again? I argued for baseball that human nature plus time plus distance plus this gravity plus average barometric pressure plus the size and frame and strength of a human body and what the shoulder can do in throwing will make baseball happen every time. And it's going to end up at roughly these dimensions because they're the right dimensions for the sport given those parameters. When it comes to military stuff, what are the things that are going to happen every single time you start the world over in your opinion? Straits of Malacca. There's a choke point there, the Strait of Malacca, and this shipping is going to go through there and it's going to be contested in that area of the world. I mean, over in the Strait of Hormuz, we're going to have issues there. So there will always be a place on any map that you make that is more desirable than others. You're probably going to build the Panama Canal every time. Okay, you're probably going to make the Suez Canal every time. What about on the battlefield? What are the things that will just evolve at some point if you start the world over 100 times? Artillery. It's going to happen. Why? Because you are quickly going to arrive at how to injure someone at distance. And then once you do that, that guy he was sitting there talking about, yeah, we had a guy calling out our target so that you could put effective fire on a certain target. That's not unlike what J-Tacks do. Or these people in modern military, they say, hey, they're calling in fire and you have to have a smart person in that role. And then you just have to have doomsday lobbers that are over there firing the thing. It's just amazing. Meaning, you're going to have to have people putting, what did he say, helium isotopes or what do you think? That's what he said, yeah. Or hydrogen. I don't even want to say, you're going to have to have people bringing bullets to the front line like they are in Ukraine and Russia right now, the 155. Yeah. And why did artillery exist in the ancient world? Why did it? Yeah. How did it exist? Oh, like catapult ballistas to destroy the enemy at distance. Yeah, but why wouldn't the enemy just spread out? Make it really inefficient to load up a catapult with a giant boulder to try to squash one dude. I don't know. Because then the infantry can take him out easier. Yeah. Well, the one dude would just run away when the boulder is flying at him. He'd look at it and be like, well, I wouldn't want that to hit me. So he'd just run away. You use it to disrupt formations that enhance the power of the individual who on an ancient battlefield, when they work in formation, they can defeat a rival formation of say a light infantry shooting the Larrows. Well, how do you beat that? How do you beat the little arrows on the battlefield? Shield and speed. Shields and speed. That's how you do it. China figured it out. Japan figured it out. Mesopotamia figured it out. Egypt figured it out. Europe figured it out. Warfare. It looks like it played out a little differently in Africa, Australia, and North America. But like the mega civilizations, they just all went through the same progression. And even a lot of the more guerrilla style combat, mounted archer combat that you see in the Asian steps Mongolia, the plains of North America, even there they all reasoned to the same stuff. Well, this is the best way to ride this horse. And this is the best way to shoot well mounted. Everybody comes to the exact same conclusions eventually, because people are about this tall. They're about this fast. It takes about this long to accomplish this. You need something about this sturdy to get through somebody else's armor. You can shoot an arrow about this far. And so all of this, it comes down to the same kinds of questions, but I've just never run the scenario at this level of detail in space. And what do you know? It's a whole bunch of the same considerations. That's amazing. What's interesting about this is, let's say humans become interplanetary species. Don't know that's going to happen. But let's say it does. Some of these things are going to play out. Like if certainly if it becomes an interstellar species, then that's amazing. That's interesting to think about, isn't it? There will be pinch points in space. Yeah. Uh huh. Like the fact you, right now you can get to Mars about once every, what is it, 18 months? Or what is it? I don't know what it is. Like there's a window of opportunity to go to Mars. I should know this. Okay. Yeah, that will affect military logistics in space. That's interesting, man. I enjoyed, I enjoyed talking to Carnera. That was amazing. Yeah. That's going to stick with me. Okay. My last thought from that though, before we land the plane, the adrenaline, he still felt it. He could take himself back to that place. And when he kept using the language of this made an impression on us, I said like, what kind of clout do you get? It was like, I don't get much clout. Just collegiality. My words not his, but that's what he was saying. We get collegiality, whether they fought on our side or not. It's like, oh, you were there. Yeah. Cause you both felt like Saint Crispin's day, didn't it? Yeah. Okay. He will be my brother on Saint Crispin's day. Be tack are. There we go. That's fascinating. Yeah. I mean, they went through a thing together and it imprinted on their souls. And he made it clear. Everyone will remember this who was there. They'll remember how they felt. They'll remember the day. He's talking about stuff that makes an impression on you and me. Like I wasn't alive for it, but you asked somebody older than us, you know, 10, 15 years older than us. Where were you when JFK got shot? Everybody knows. My dad knows the answer to that question. I remember exactly the day the challenge you're exploded. And I was very young when that happened, but I remember everybody has their 9-11 story. Whatever your country's thing is, you have that, but for them, be tack are is another thing. And they all know where they were and what it was like. And when they realized it was going on and the adrenaline, I think that's wild. My understanding is there have been larger battles in the E-Von line since then. I think they're called like M2, the latest ones, M5 or whatever. I don't know. But my understanding of these battles have been larger since then. And some of these players that were there have factored into those as well. But there's a certain place in history that B-Tack are takes. Thanks for doing that with me. That was your one. Great idea. Wonderful. Wonderful topic.
