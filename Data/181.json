My face hurts. Do you know that feeling you get when you blow up too many balloons? Ha ha ha! No I don't! You don't? No! It's the one where the muscles in your cheeks get all tender because they're not used to blowing up a hundred balloons for a party. Oh, so like the upper cheek cramp area? Yes, that. That's how I feel. Really? Yeah. Because I grinned for three consecutive hours without taking a single break to make sure my face muscles wouldn't get damaged in the process. It was... I'm just going to level with you dude. I went expecting it to be a joke. And I expected to be a bunch of just completely dumb people. Like how could I believe this? But I totally went on the ride dude. How can you not? I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes and the first wrestlers came in. And I'm still trying to be dignified I guess. Let me put it this way. I went in worried that everyone else would be so into it that I would feel like an idiot for not knowing what to do and going too small. By the end I was concerned that I was too into it and that everybody else was put off by my level of enthusiasm. I think we should catch the third chair up on what we're talking about. Please do. Okay, so a while back we did an episode called the truth about wrestling. And we interviewed the locksmith, right? Do you remember what episode that was? I do not. Let me look that up. Alright. Questions? The truth about wrestling. Okay, so that was episode 149. Alright. So the locksmith Brandon Williams, that's his wrestling name. Yes. We decided that we were going to have an official like, I don't know, it's not like a patron saint of the podcast but it's a patron wrestler of the podcast. Yeah, he's the official pro wrestler of the podcast. He's the only one we root for. That's right. That's right. There you go. That's a good way of saying it. It's a local wrestling match at a local civic center. I'd let you know and you booked a flight. I did. Yes. For that. Yes. It cost $20 to attend. We weren't willing to go $30 for the front row. No, 20 for the second row. 20 for the second row. Seemed a good deal. Yeah. And I flew here leaving my family behind. Yes. To be here for the pro wrestling match. The local local pro wrestling match. Okay. Just so you know, I've been telling the kids, I worked with some kids at church and I've been telling some of these high school boys for a few weeks. I'm like, Hey, this is going to happen. I'm going. Who's in? Matt, we had 18 people there last night. Yes, we did. And once those 18 people working as one figured out what the vibe was, there was no stop. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, there's so many favorite parts. I have, I have many favorite parts. How did you feel when the first wrestlers walked in? So they didn't dim the lights at all. No. I mean, you're basically in a community gym. Right. And there's a ring in the middle. What did you make of the ring? Smaller than I was expecting. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking it wasn't much bigger than a trampoline you'd have in the backyard. Yeah. It was half the size I expected. Yes. But once the match got going, it felt right. It did. It did. I didn't expect that. So I believe it's called New South Pro Wrestling. I think that is correct. I believe they own the ring and they have to let go and set it up because at the end, we could see the wrestlers like, Hey, I got to go tear the ring down now. Right. So it seemed like a community like they're, they're their own little community. Yeah. And it was weird to see two people working together who just an hour earlier had been locked in pitch physical combat. And then when one wasn't looking, the other one smashed them on the back of the head while their manager distracted the useless ref. And then a second later, a magic wizard witch princess came in with deer horns on and blue black spit in his face, magic black spit. And then they're all chummy afterwards taken down a ring. I find that hard to believe. Yeah. That was the first thing that made me think. Now hold on a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second. That was the first thing. What about when Rita? Sure. Rita raccoon. Rita trash panda. Yeah. Yeah. When she was obviously borderline incapacitated and her opponent like had her by the back and he started pulling her tail and she expressed pain during that. Shreaked in agony while he pulled on her raccoon tail. Yes. He put one foot squarely on her butt. So there'd be resistance so that all of the energy would go to that joint between the tail and the butt that you get in raccoons. Yeah. And he yanked mercilessly. Yes. She shrieked and clawed at the mat while that was going on. I felt for her. So I think one of the things that was really fun is there were several people that showed up. One of which was Chappie or basically Harold Wilber for Sandlin. Yeah. Chappie showed up and he brought his A game in terms of cheering. That was amazing. Plus even. Yeah. So would it be fun just to tell the story of how this happened? Let's just tell the story of last night. I think any time a story is one where at the beginning you have one set of opinions and assumptions and at the end you have a different set of opinions and assumptions. And I also think that any story wherein at the beginning you didn't have a thing you'd remember forever until the day you die and at the end you do. Any such story with these elements is a good story and it's one worth telling and I think we should game it out. I think we should. So let's I don't know how about we do the fancy time travel harp music and we go back to when you and I found ourselves fabricating jumbo size locks to take so that we could hold them above our heads at the locksmith's wrestling match. What do you think? Should we go back there? Yeah. So we just start with the recording of us making the giant prop locks and working on the chant that we're going to employ at the event hovering over a trash can in your yard earlier that day. Yeah. Perfect. All right. That looks like a lot. Playing this day. That's a lot. All right. So here's what we got. We got a prop. That's a lock. All right. Here's what we got. We got a pool noodle and we've cut two holes in the top of a cardboard box and we've created a lock in it. It's completely believable. Dude, we make this we use this duct tape. Everyone will know who we're rooting for. Oh, there's no question. All right. Hold it upright and then I'll I'll do the circle circle. All right. I see. How do you want to cut a keyhole through the tape? Oh, it's a great idea. Oh, God. This is awesome. We're making a cardboard lock. How stupid is this? It was a box and a pool noodle and a function and teamwork. How did you feel about the locks? Straight up, dude. Some of our best work. It was amazing how we made something that good and something that would prove to be that consequential. Yes. That quickly. Yeah. So the thing I liked about using the duct tape for the locks is that you know how some padlocks they're made out of laminated sheets of steel? Yeah, stacked metal. Yeah, it had the same texture. Yeah, the strips of duct tape wrapped equatorially around the cardboard ended up looking just like that. And the pool noodle, I thought your innovation of wrapping the duct tape in a helical pattern around the pool noodle. I thought that was pretty good. Well, thank you for that. Yeah. I particularly appreciated the way the pool noodle for the pivoting locks segment was big enough that we could wear them like the flable flavor of locks. Yes. If we wanted to. Yes. And we wanted to. We did want to. I did like that. So, all right. So we had our locks. We went to the venue and I was pleased to see that Brandon was collecting money at the door. Like he was working the admissions. Everyone was working. I would tell that all the people who were doing all the things were also going to be wrestlers. Yeah. So they all get the nerves and the anticipation, but also they need to make you feel welcome at the event and help you figure out which seat is yours. Right. Right. That was odd to me. That was a little odd. I found it endearing. I thought it was really good. Oh, by the way, uh, Destin, yeah, we've got that second row over there reserved for you guys. A lot of a lot of young guys showed up and some of the other adults and we had a blast. And what did you think about where our seats were? Second row. I wasn't ready for first row. Second row was a little close for me because I could tell when the first wrestlers came out, they were very mingly. They were in the second row with us. One of those guys after he got hit right there in the Jimmy Johns, he goes crawling through saying something to that effect and gripping his midsection in pain. And I was like, that guy's right here now with his sweat and everything. So even row two seemed a little too close and the early going to me. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. What is that? What is that? What is that? What did you think about how it started? Like I expected, well, I expected them to say, let's get ready to rumble. That was not said. And I, that's copyrighted, man. That's worth a lot of money to say that. I'm not allowed to say that. We might get flagged for saying that even here. It's a big deal. You can't just say that. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. No, you did it. Well, my bad. I expected people just to start wrestling. I expected to hear what the names of the wrestlers were going to be. And I expected them to get in the ring and we were like going to hold their arms up and be like, this is Billy Barracuda and this is Johnny, whatever. And that's not what happened. No, they just came out from backstage from the curtain. Yes. And they just started going as soon as they hit the ring. Yes. And I had no idea what to do. Air punches. The first 10 punches didn't land. I was like, I don't know how to cheer for this, man. Yeah. Because I'm right here. That clearly, not only did it not hit him, you forgot to do the stomp thing. It didn't even make a fake sound when you fake hit him. Nothing just happened. It's hard to get hyped for that. But there was no hype, man. The ring announcer forgot to introduce two or three of the bouts. I think sometimes he got up in the ring. He was wearing a suit. He looked sharp. He did. And he get the mic out and he'd be like, Oh, for the next bout. Which will be one fall. And then the whole crowd goes one fall. Yeah, which I didn't understand that at first, but I was in it by the end. Yeah. The fall. The moment is it. The round is zero. Sprint one. That's the floor of the ring. Fall. We got so and so versus so and so, but there were a few matches where just some classic rock played and some people walked in and outfits and then they just fought and they left later. Yeah. It was awesome. It was awesome. Yeah. It was a pandemonium and you're right. When they started crawling around, I found the wrestlers ability to hide. It's almost like they had some kind of cloaking technology. Yes. Because there were more than one occasion where the wrestler would go in the ring and start fighting and then some kind of tag team thing would break out. Yes. And the person that was kind of fleeing would go behind a bystander, just like a person watching the whole thing and kind of kneel down behind them and like look around them. And when they did that, I noticed that the wrestlers that were in the ring were so distracted by what was happening, they could not find their opponent in the crowd. Did you notice that? I did notice that. I wasn't sure whether or not to totally believe that because of how you could just sort of scan the crowd and the general attire of the crowd. I would say was a step below business casual. Yeah. I would say so. I would say that the shirts, ball caps, most of the wrestlers were dressed differently than that. A lot of them had on sequins and no shirt. Yes. Which you think would make them real easy to pick out of a lineup. But I lost track of them at times. Yeah. I really honestly did. I totally did. I was like, where's the guy with the skin tight chaps on that are covered in sequins and the huge cowboy hat and like the giant prop axe or whatever. Wasn't he just here? No, he's just hiding behind Edna in the second row. One thing I thought was interesting is it's kind of like magic tricks, the sleight of hand. They're like, hey, look over here and they're doing something really big and wavy and flamboyant with one hand. And they're like picking your pocket with the other. I'm not implying that they were picking our pockets. But they would do something really big. Some guy would jump off of something and then one of the wrestlers would just disappear. And he was gone for the night. I was like, what happened? Gone for the night is the truth. Yeah. They were never part of the story again. They were just gone. Yeah. Maybe they were under the mat for the rest of the night. I don't know where they went. I don't either. It happened again and again. They're really early on. I figured out, okay, this, there's a big range of error here that ranges from missed by 12 inches. And it's hard for me to pretend to be hyped to you just punch that guy in the neck as hard as you could with a closed fist. And it landed. I don't think you should do that. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. All right. So let's discuss how to cheer somebody I knew was there. And I went over and I said, Hey man, this is my first time I've ever been at something like this. I don't really know what to do. And he said, Oh dude, these are awesome. This is a really cool dude. He's like, Oh, these are great. He's a great, I was like, what do you mean? I got like 15 kids over there from church. I was like, how is this going to go down? He goes, Oh, it's going to be great. Just tell them some of these people in here like that redneck over there, he's going to stand up. He's going to yell and he's going to believe it. And he's going to be legitimately angry. Just know that everything's going to be okay. Yeah. Every bit of that happened. It did that guy stood up and had a confrontation with a couple of the wrestlers. I believe he called them cowards chickens, chickens. That's what it was. Chickens. Chickens. And then everybody was uncomfortable and some people came over like in playing clothes to sort of stand by the guy. Be like, Hey, don't attack the wrestlers, please. But all of us, we tried to calm the situation down by leaping out of our seats and all that bending our elbows like chickens and making ball balls out. So marvelous de-escalation technique. So my favorite thing was watching my daughter watch us like my teenage daughter who can drive. I'm watching her watch us. And as we do, I don't, I don't know how we did it, but we just kind of escalated slowly. Yes. Did you feel that? Yes. I didn't expect that. What did you expect? I don't know. I expected to go there with my big lock and cheer for the locksmith. The one thing I told everybody is like the one thing we want to do if we accomplish a chant for the locksmith that is like it just goes up. It goes up because like if we can do that, we have succeeded. What if we do it eight times? That'd be great. Well, we did. We did. So I expected to take our little foam locks. And if we could get that channel off one time, then we would be successful. That's all I expected. What I didn't realize is when two new competitors would come out, there's this like 30 seconds to one minute, I don't know, it was like you were living in fan purgatory for a minute. And you were trying to figure out what, who am I going to cheer for? Who's the face and who's the heel? Yes. And given that we know who the heel is, do I want to boo them or do I want to actually root for the heel? How did you figure out who to root for? By the vibes. Not me. There was a lady. I think her name is Tanya. I know exactly what you're going to say. She was. She was across the range of the corner from us. Just the exact opposite side from us. And she had some neon cardboard. It's not what you expect. It's not like in Mike Tyson's Punch Out or something where you get like the scantily clad bikini lady that comes out with signs. No, that's not how Tanya was at all. No, no. She's just some lady. But she's got these signs and they're in two stacks. And the first stack says the emotion you should feel like yay or boo. And so she could hold that one up first. But then in the other stack, there was the name of the wrestler about whom you should feel a given emotion. Yes. Or she could flip it around and have it say the name of the wrestler and then sucks. Yes. I just waited for Tanya to signal what was supposed to be happening here. And then I would learn the name of the wrestlers and how to feel about them. For example, I wasn't sure who the good guy was when Big Dave came out. But then she held up a sign that said yay and big day. It literally said yay, big day. So I was like, well, I'll root for him then. Tanya knows. Well, let me let me ask you this. If there is one physical attribute that you would have to, I don't know, like how would you describe Big Dave based on the name or based on what I saw based on what you experienced. That guy's the biggest man alive. He's the biggest man alive. He's the biggest man alive. How do you know that? Well, he said it repeatedly. He comes out. There's two and I loved it. So we're like, what are we rooting for here? And then two guys come out and you get the hometown guy. And they announce him as the hometown guy. Yeah. And everybody's like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. This is the hometown guy. But then. And then Big Dave comes out wearing a Jeff Gordon NASCAR shirt. Yeah. Big cowboy hat. And knee high boots in like tidy wities only. They were black and not tidy and they were not tight. They were not tight at all. They were loose nerve rackingly loose. And so Big Dave comes out and he goes to the front of the, walking around the ring and he just looks at everybody and goes, I'm the biggest man alive. And we all. And you do a door. We all repeated back. No, no, no. The three second pause. You have to explain that. What the three second pause? What do you mean? I mean, I'm the biggest man alive. And she said she looks at us and we were dumbstruck for like three seconds. And then we all at the same time said, yeah, you are big day. You're the biggest man alive, Big Dave. Here's one of the things I would say about Big Dave. Just quantitatively. He might not be the biggest man alive. In fact, I think I know the names of some men who are bigger than Big Dave. I do too. I'd put Big Dave around the 65th percentile actually. Yeah. But how does that sound if you get into a ring and yell that? It doesn't sound good. I'm in the 65th percentile of largeness. Right. It's not fun at all. It doesn't have the power to move men's hearts. So we've got a new sponsor today, right? Yeah, I'm really excited about this because I know the guy who owns this company. Yeah. Who's that? It's my pal Luke. I've known him forever. I've known him since he was a young man. And I've watched him have an idea and chase down the idea and build the idea and be very modest about its success and undersell to me how effective the idea has been. And a while back, he and I were talking and catching up and he was like, we should do the thing. It would be helpful for us to sponsor NDQ. And we talked about it a little bit and we decided to do it. All right. So can I explain the idea? Because I've checked it out a little bit here. Please do. Yeah. It's called company cam. And my understanding is this is an awesome tool and an app that contractors can use to keep up with a job at a job site. They have a really, really good website, just companycam.com, which I have to say is a fantastic name. That's a good brand, right? Agreed. All the different industries that use company cam, you've got people like electrical contractors, flooring, fencing, plumbing, HVAC, anything you can imagine doing, like any job, roofing. In fact, the brothers started this company as roofers. They had this roofing company and they were having a hard time keeping up with like the before and after shots of the thing and generating their reports afterwards. And so they created this app to do all the hard work and they said, well, if we can make an app that works for us, then it'll work for anybody. And dude, that's genius. You know him. Can we just call him? Yeah, he usually picks up. What's up, Luke? I got questions for you, man. I got questions for you, man. No. Oh boy. So that's what I'm here for. If you were hosting the show, what would be your 60 second pitch for what this is and why people should try it? I would talk about that running a contracting business is hard and it's hard because you have a different customer. The work doesn't happen at your office. It's like kind of happening all over the place in the daily communication, coordination, accountability. It's a hard problem no matter how much tech you have. But when you are empowering your people to capture this information on the ground, you're empowering yourself to do effective accountability where you can actually see what's going on. You can know the state of your different projects. It will solve problems that you have that you didn't even know were solvable. Like you know when you're disorganized, but you don't know how your day will change and how much easier and more clarity you'll get when you just know what's going on and you make it easier for yourself to hold people accountable. That uncertainty of how's that job going? Do we get the material? There's all these questions every day that you don't know the answer to that act as this like base level of anxiety that you can dramatically lower with company cam. You really have to experience it to know. What do you hope happens if someone is listening to this podcast and they heard about company cam and they try it for the first time when they have the app in their hands and they're assigning tasks to team members or whatever, what do you hope happens the first time they use it? What I hope happens is that they get a few people from their company using it and then these people around, they're going to be taking pictures, they're going to be writing notes, they're going to be just using the app in the field that all of a sudden they are seeing more than they've ever seen before. To in a sense be ahead of the game, whereas before they would have been kind of behind the game or they would have found out they had a problem 18 months from now when a roof is leaking rather than instantly when they see a picture fly through. We just believe that if you try it, you will want to keep using it and then that's a win for everyone. Okay. So the objective of this is to get people to download the free version of the app, the trial, try the thing out. I did not have to enter credit card to do that. This is pretty easy to jump in and give it a go so that you know they're coming from us and that this worked in some way when it asked you where they heard about it. Select podcasts, put in no-dom questions. So there's no promo code or anything to put the name of this podcast in there that'd be kind if people would be willing to do that. And you think most people will stick if they try it out. They'll figure out the application. Exactly. Yes. If they get like three people out there company, I mean they don't have to have that many people but like really this is for teams. If they get three people using it, they won't stop using it overwhelmingly. They'll be like, oh, I don't want to go back to not knowing what was going on. Dude, thank you so much for being willing to sponsor no-dom questions. Matt told me that you kind of went out on a limb and just said, hey, man, we want to help. That's really cool of you. Thank you very much. Hey, you're welcome. I did it. I love what you guys are doing. Top to bottom. It is figuratively and literally the Lord's work. I'm just reading for you. I think it's going to be good for us. Both sides of it. I appreciate you doing this and I'll talk to you guys later. Later, man. See you. Luke's awesome. He made an awesome thing. We're grateful that he sponsored companycam.com and the app is the app on Google as well, Matt. It is. Yep. So what do people do when they sign up? Grab the app, download the free trial and when it asks how you heard about it, select the podcast option, hit no-dom questions and then fiddle around with it. Try it out. That's awesome. Thank you for supporting the sponsors. When you do that, you support the podcast. I realized like, look, dude, when Brandon the locksmith told me, just spend $20 and go to a wrestling match and just watch it. When he said it's going to be fun, there's very few things you can spend $20 on to get this level of entertainment. I was like, you know, I'd be willing to try that. I'd be willing to try that. If you'd have told me three weeks ago that I would be in a crowd yelling at a man agreeing with him that he is in fact the biggest man alive and believing it in my heart while making chicken gestures at the other guy who you weren't sure how to feel about five seconds earlier. Yeah. It would be very difficult for you to convince me of that. Okay. But it happened. I mean, obviously we were just all in. We were full send. But not immediately. We weren't. I didn't know what to do. I was sitting next to your teenage son and the first batch comes in. I'm sitting next to a bunch of his friends. Oh, you explain what Iggy did. Well, yeah, that's it. That's what I'm where I'm going with this. They felt like the thing that they should do is yell at the wrestlers they think are bad. So they did. And none of them ever crossed the line. They yelled things like, that's a weak kick. That's a chomp move. Oh, he's got your, he's got your partner. It was the most awful taunts ever. Yeah. But every single one of them to the heels was like an insult about his mom. Oh, really? And pretty quickly, everybody figured out our quadrant was the fun quadrant. Yes. All the wrestlers figured that out pretty quickly and they start yelling back and berating these high school boys. Yes, they did. And so out come the heels. They're the carnies. Yo, the carnival workers. I didn't really see how that is what they were. I don't get it at all, but they were good. That's the name of their little squad, the carnies. Yeah, Iggy Carney and other guy Carney. Okay. Rolly belly, Carney. And the one guy comes out. He's pretty chunky. He's got walrus chops and he unstraps his singlet all sultry like like, check this out. And everybody's like, oh, get it back on. Put it back on. And he's all tattooed up, typical tattoo green on his jiggly belly. And he just starts doing this belly shimmy thing. It's like a wave. And it is, I mean, it's like what happens if you push on a partially filled water bed without sheets on it. It just ripples through and ripples back and it's kind of elegant and mesmerizing in its own way. But then you're like, no, no, I'm not looking at that and getting mesmerized, but it was mesmerizing. Well, while this guy's mesmerizing us with his belly rolling, the other guy, his partner, who's got the pulled back high fade ponytail thing, Iggy, Iggy, he comes down and I don't remember who it was, but it was a young man sitting right in front of me. He went to give him a fist bump from the second row. Yep. And he's the heel. The heel doesn't get fist bumps. Yep. So he comes down to give the fist bump and the high school kid we were there with pulled it back at the last second. All of us knew what to say. What was that? Oh, gotcha. And then Harold says, got him. He's so primitive. And then Chappie, Mr. Wilberforce, he's like, no, no, no, come on. I gotcha. And he holds out his fist to the same wrestler. And the guy comes right back and a second before they make contact, Iggy pulls it back and just gives him the super aggressive middle finger right. It's right. That was so good. And these kids from church turned around and they looked at me like, what is happening? I don't know. I think that was cool. It was so funny. He did not stop flipping us off for the rest of the match. It was every opportunity. Maybe you guys wanted a couple more of these. Did you see a couple of times he was like pinned down and he was looking over at us? Did you see that? He gave us the middle finger while underneath his opponent from the match. It was so good at what he did. Oh, man. Great. I know. I don't know. I thought it was amazing, dude. I had no idea it was going to be that fun. He mocked one of the kids who was there with us for having his arm in a sling. My son blatantly mocked him. He blocked him for having broken. You saw Kiki Karni. Your arms broken. Your son's like, oh. I guess it is. They learned things that night. They did. It was glorious. I loved that match with those two because they hated us so much. And then right after them, we get a break. So we get up and walk around. There's an intermission with a music or something. And the wrestlers who were already done, they're all at their little tables signing stuff and whatnot. And there's this kid. You probably didn't see him from where you were sitting. I wasn't by you at this point. But in that opening match when, who's the locksmith's rival? Oh, Donnie Primetime. Donnie Primetime. Yeah. Mm. That Donnie Primetime. He was hard to root for, but I think we were supposed to like it. I think we were supposed to. Well, he lost. Yeah. And that made a little yellow-haired seven-year-old boy on the next leg of the mat sitting in the front row with Donnie Primetime gear. It made him break down and weep hysterically. Are you serious? Donnie Primetime. Donnie Primetime didn't win his match. Well, it didn't help that after he lost his match, they like sucked his soul out or whatever that was. Yeah, there was a demon woman, a pagan priestess, Wiccan, who came over and she drank evil and then spat the evil in some sort of sporus-somal form into his face to infect him with her evil. I think she put her evil inside him. I think that was it. I did not like that at all. You shouldn't do that. I could have done without that. Keep your damn evil to yourself. I did like it. That's what my grandparents always taught me. And so it was fascinating, but the moment that the locksmith came out, I'm going to be real with you, man. When Brandon came out, I felt something. I felt I did. You're going to need to clarify something. I was like happy for him because he's there in the ring and we're all there and we're with the locksmith. The locksmith! The locksmith! The locksmith! The locksmith! The locksmith! The locksmith! The locksmith is there! The locksmith! The locksmith! And we've got those locks and we're elevating them. And when he got in the ring and he turned around and he looked at us, you felt it. You felt it. I felt it. Keep going. Like, he was so happy we were there and he was so excited that not only was he about to wrestle, which clearly Brandon loves doing. Yes, but he had a legit fan section. Yes. We were unironically cheering for him. Oh, we had a doubt. Dude is basically wearing spandex underwear, and he is going up there to entertain us, and we paid 20 bucks for this ticket. No, dude. I'm in. I am legitimately unironically rooting for you to win and have fun and show well and succeed. And I was actually concerned that he was going to lose. I was concerned about that. I was like, I really, in my heart, I want the locksmith to win. Well when his tag team partner Rita was getting her tail pulled by sexy Sam. Was that his name? Yeah, I think so. And then the two angry circus twins were over there like goons cheering and hissing at him. I was like, this has got to be a really tough moment for the locksmith just emotionally to watch his partner go through that. And there's nothing he can do because they can't reach hands. It's like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel with God and man. Yeah, they're close to making contact. And could they have made contact? If Brandon had just straightened his arm the whole way? Yes, absolutely. But that wasn't an option. It was not an option. For reasons that you can't, you just can't. Her tail needed to get pulled a little bit longer before finally they mustered the ability to make contact. And so simultaneously, this is the juxtaposition for me, dude. This is ridiculous because as soon as the trash panda girl got back in the game and mustard her energy, she immediately went into a chest scratch attack and shriek move. Claude the guy up. I was like, I don't feel great about this. But then the locksmith gets tagged in and he goes into his most assertive series of grappling moves because that's his deal. He's not a high flyer. No, he's very technical. In fact, I said that. Like I said, during the match, he's very technical. He's very technical. It's me. Break it off. Yes. Because you kind of say what you're seeing. I think that helps. Yes. Yeah. Like lock him up. Yes, exactly. Or he's locked up. Things like that. Yes. Generally, you want it to be three words. Yes. But he comes in and I could tell that they were about to win because before he'd been doing some holds and some grappling and stuff, but wrestling and I could just tell I recognize the rhythm of story, right? I'm like, okay, everybody knows at this point this guy is in his element and he gets to do his thing. We don't know who's going to win the match, but he knows. He told us that they know who wins the match. He's slated to win. He's playing for the home crowd. So you were reading him. I was reading him. You know, I was not going to ask him going in like, dude, you went in tonight? No way. I'm not putting him that spot. There's no way I'm going to ask. But as soon as he came back in after the whole raccoon incident and he gets to start doing his thing and he's making sure he's facing our direction. Was he? You notice that? I did not notice that. His backside was never to us when he did his specialty stuff, his grappling and arm bars and locks and all of that. He was always facing us. So his fan section could appreciate all the intricacies of what he was doing. I didn't see that. And as soon as he went into that, it's like, oh, the hero is powered up and is able to do the special moves. He has the shot. It's got the shine. Like this is it. He's going to win. And sure enough, it's the way it played out. But dude, from the moment he came in and his music came on and we realized it's the locksmith, nobody got that reaction. The whole night is probably what we say, 300 people in the room. Yeah. Which I think is a really good turnout. It impressed me. Yeah. He comes in, he gets the best reaction of the whole night because immediately 20 people and then thought contagion happens. Another 10 around us leap to their feet. We got these giant oversized ridiculous cartoon locks. We're not ironically cheering. We are rooting for the guy and he fed on it. He did. You could see it. And then he wins. We get what we came to see. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, so, we were in there lock. Him up, lock him up, but then his opponent, Sam, he tags in somebody else. Yes. The girl and she comes in and then it goes from lock him up to lock her up. Yep, lock her immediate pronoun adjustment, very sophisticated in our part. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. 1. And then I don't know how the accounts, but they double tagged in, and there were multiple people in there, and that finishing move, dude, where he locked both of those girls up by the feet, whoever, and we said, lock them up. Lock them up. And he did. Yeah, and they simul tapped out. Yes. It wasn't like one reached the point where she couldn't bear it any longer, because they're twins. They have that psychic empathetic link. They both felt the same amount of pain from each other and from their own bodies, and they knew to simultaneously tap out at the same time. Cue the music, cue the celebration, cue the locks in the air, cue the complete emotional freak out from the entire cheering section. Dude, the two things that were said during that one right there is when Chappy is sitting to my left, so the locksmith gets Sam in some kind of arm bar thing, and Chappy just says, break it off! Break off his leg or his arm or whatever. Break it off! So silly, dude. Okay, what's the second one? Well, the second one, was this with you? I think this might have been during Big Dave's match. So when we're sitting there, and the guy incapacitates his opponent, and he damages his arm, right? He spins it. I think it was at least 720 degrees of rotation as the shoulder roll. What are you doing? He rotates the arm around, and then the guy can't move, and then you just scream out in a quiet moment. It's like, when that moment, when everything goes quiet, you just scream out, use your other arm! It was so stupid, and you immediately hit in your hood, and you just heard bears. I'm still embarrassed. I'm still embarrassed. You just mean nervous, sweaty. I'm like, what appears? Use your other arm. The other thing you said, I can't remember it was Big Dave, or the other guy is, the guy is like bearing down on the guy. He's like, oh, like I've got him in a hole. And he's like, I'm overpowering you. And it's quiet in the hole of the thing. And you just scream out, reverse it, reverse it! And he's like, oh, I haven't thought of that. And he did it, and then he reversed it. And he was able to overpower his opponent, because your ability to deliver teamwork. You have to have a power of teamwork. Oh crap. Oh dude, it was good. I enjoyed it, man. I'm glad the locksmith won. I'm just... It was wonderful. I'm excited about that. Yeah, well we get to the halfway point, so locksmith, there's one more after that, and then there's an intermission. And I think everybody felt like our job here is done. We should all leave. So everybody said goodbye to each other from our whole group. Like, I got some stuff I got to knock out. So I better... Pat the thighs. Check for the keys. I better... Mrs. is probably wondering what... Maybe I'll stay for the first match. Just a little bit. When I checked in with you, I was like, are we done here? Are we good? And you were like, well, maybe we need to... We were all through in there. But nobody would leave. And then I was like, oh, is that the music? I guess it's starting back to the end. I'm just going to grab my cigarette break. I don't want the wrestlers to feel like we're walking out on it. Yeah, that would be embarrassing. It'd be demoralizing. Let's just stay put until the next break. We're never leaving. We're the last ones out of the building and we had to be asked to leave. I think it was just the suspension of disbelief was just a thing. Like, we went in there just... That's what they ask of you. They ask of you to pretend this is serious. But what I noticed when I was looking around the crowd is there were one or two cell phones up, but they were taking pictures. People weren't tweeting. They weren't looking at social media. No. They were locked in. They were watching what was happening. And I got to thinking to myself, what can you pay $20 for? Now, am I going to be doing this every month? Probably not. No, probably more like weekly. I can't see myself going to another one anytime soon. But it was a great thing to have done. And I will remember it. And I cannot think of very many things that I could pay $20 for that would give me lifelong memories like that. Can you? No. No, it was special. I got on the phone with Camilla last night and she's like, how was the wrestling? Oh, sweetie, thank you so much for asking. An hour later, I'm crying again. And I can tell she's on our keyboard or working or something. Oh, yeah. That's great. She was doing her best. It was late. She was tired. But I really wanted to talk about that raslin. Dude. Because I was a blast. And I never felt the impulse to check my phone. No. Not even like, I shouldn't. I'm at a thing. I should be respectful. No. It never even occurred to me to get it out other than to grab a few photos of the most ridiculous moments. Yeah. And I didn't see you go for yours. No, I just took a couple of shots and video and I was very interested in the kids around me. Like, what are they doing? At one time, the one guy that was sitting by you, he had one of the locks we had made and he was holding it to his chest like a child would hold a teddy bear. And he was watching the match through the clasp of the lock, which was a foam pool noodle that we wrapped up take for him. He was watching it through that. And I was like, man, that's incredible. So at that moment, this was after the locksmith had already wrestled. I pulled out my phone and I sent one text. I texted Brandon. I said, dude, this is a great show. The kids are totally going on the ride, which is what he called it when he was explaining wrestling to us. They're going on the ride. All that being said, there were a couple things about it that worried me. Was it when the one guy kicked the other guy right in the base of his spine and then he held it and went to his knees and looked up at us with eyes that said, please help me. I'm badly injured. Was that it? I mean, there were a couple moments where they sold the injuries to the point where I was like, I'm actually concerned. Yes. And then there were a couple of times when they did a move or whatever. And I was like, I'm pretty sure that guy just hit his head. Yes. Like, it's because, you know, in high school sports now, when there's a head injury, I watched a soccer game recently. There was one kid that kicked the ball really hard. They were going for a score and it just hit the other kid in the face squarely and, you know, their head goes back and it's in their days for a second and the ref stops the game. Like, hey, stop concussion protocol is in effect. Go to the sideline. You're out for a week. You know, you have to be evaluated by a medical professional at this point. A couple of hits happened that I would say far exceeded what my concussion protocol would have been. Yeah. That bothered me. That happened twice that I can think of. It was in the last match. What's the highest in the air you think anybody's, any part of anybody's body was at that event? I'll tell you exactly. So we're watching the ring on the left side. There was a time where one of one of the high fliers got got up. It may have been Donnie prime time or it would have been one of the carneys. They got up on the turnbuckle opposite the ring from us on the left and they jumped down onto the floor. Mm hmm. Onto that, I don't know, the Norse looking demon guy or whatever. Yeah, right. And clearly he, his job was to catch him slash be incapacitated by the flying thing. Yes. And he did that, but he was legit probably 10 feet off the ground. Maybe more. Maybe more. How high is the ring? Three feet? Yeah, I'd say three feet. Okay. How high are the turnbuckles? Another three feet? They're probably five. Oh, yeah. Cause you don't just go over the top. If you, I bet they're five. Yeah. So let's say we're at eight feet at the top of the turnbuckle. Well, that seems about right. Yeah. Like certainly the top of the turnbuckle still felt like something you could hop up and just tap the top of it. So call it eight feet. Then how high is Johnny Donnie, Star Shine, Starbuckle? What the heck is his name? Denny Primetime. Denny Primetime. Six footer? Yeah, he has six feet. Okay. So now we're at 14 feet and he jumped up off of that turnbuckle and he turned downward in a swan dive. Like a belly flop. Yes. No, his head was below his waist at one point in that flight. Yes. So we're at 14 feet standing, even if he only got 12 more inches. That's 15 feet in the air, dude. It was too much. I thought it was too much. I think I actually turned to you or one of the other adults. I was like, man, this really scares me. Like, I'm got it. We're doing this thing. We're watching them wrestle. But I was legitimately scared that these grown men were going to injure themselves in a permanent way. The last match had a whole different energy. You could tell these are the two guys who are most experienced and everybody did really well. I loved the big Dave match. Yes. He was absurd and... Well, he's the biggest man alive. He's the biggest man alive. Yeah. He completely understood the exercise. Dude grasped the assignment and then nailed it. It was wonderful and ridiculous. Perfect. Other things happened. There was more tag team matches. They were all pretty fun. But the last match was between the... I don't know if he's a local guy, but everybody locally really liked him. And he's a big dude. Toon. Toon. Yeah. Yeah. Dimensions. What would you say on big toon? We were talking about that this morning. Toon was every bit of 250 pounds. Six foot tall? Probably. Maybe a little under. Maybe a little under. Yeah. Right? Yeah. His rival comes out and he's playing the heel. The rival's name is Rico Gonzalez. Yes. And he is Mexican. And they announced him as being Mexican. Yeah. From San Francisco. Mexican. Mexico. Yeah. All San Francisco. What did he call him? He is the heartbreak killer. He is Rico Gonzalez. So he comes out and dudes in great shape, just athletic. nimble, great ups. This kid's going to be really fun to watch. And he's trying to be the heel. So he's yelling at our group a whole bunch. It seemed like they all after a match or so, figured out who the people to interact with were going to be. So the whole night was just targeted at us. Yeah. I mean, this event could be described as a dialogue between all of us and a bunch of people wearing underwear and parading around in a ring. That's completely accurate. It was nuts. So this guy comes out and of course, I mean, he's the bad guy. Tanya had a sign that said, boo Rico. It did. What are you going to do? You got a boo Rico. Not boo him. Did you see the sign? But there's a problem with that. What is the problem with that? Rico is pretty likable. He's great. And the reason he's likable is his taunts. They kind of feel real. Yes, they do. So, so our little, the high school guys that we were with, at one point, they decided to sign the chant. He is in better physical condition than anybody in the road that's clapping. Oh, no, no doubt. Yeah, it's not close. Not even close. But compared to tune, he's tiny. Yeah, sure. That was the joke. Well, I stood with Rico and talked with him at the end. Okay. He's me, but a beast. Yeah. I mean, same dimensions. You're pretty, you're a beast. I mean, you're a muscular man. He's a monster. Okay. I felt a little bit of physical intimidation. You didn't want to tussle. No, Rico would destroy me screwing around in a ring or in a street fight. He's a monster. Okay. So it's patently absurd. It would be like me making fun of your science knowledge or you making fun of my beard. They're both just unmockable things. Come on, please agree. Yeah, you have, please, I do not have a lot of science knowledge, but your beard is great. I don't even, I don't know. Could go either way. Thanks, man. Thanks. All I have. So they're mocking him for the obvious thing that if you mock him for that, you clearly don't mean it. But he took it deeply personally. Yes, he did. Do you remember what he said when he pushed back on that chant? I remember he was at the top of a turnbuckle. He turns and he points at an adult with us and a couple of kids. And I can't say what he actually said because some of it would have to be bleeped. But he basically said, have you ever been in a ring? No, you haven't. So shut your mouth. That but more colorful. Yeah. Yeah, much more colorful. And what was funny is that the adult he said it to had been had on backwards, point and fingers. It just shares and loud. He was great. Dude got it. And this is a mature, responsible adult. Yeah. Who just read the vibe. We were trying to make the room happy. Yeah. He was great. The wrestlers loved him. Nobody did anything wrong. I loved how our row conducted themselves. But in that moment, he clearly felt chastened and reverted to a Southern gentleman. And more or less took his hat off and muttered, you, yes, sir, I apologize. I've never been in a, I have not been in a room. You are correct. I've never been in a ring like that. He makes some good points. I should not have said the things I said. He changed the body language of this adult man who we were there with, who was doing nothing wrong, but it like got through the armor. And he's like, you make a good point. I probably shouldn't be. Well, if you recall, that's when you and I started looking at each other and saying, wait a second, are we cheering wrong? That was my exact question to you. Yeah. No, I didn't ask. I said, are we doing this wrong? Dude, I think we might be doing this wrong. Right. And we both got the big eyes like, oh, and then we started replaying. We were like, wait a second. In that last match, big Dave beat the hometown guy and we were cheering for big Dave. And the other guy looks head. Did we do this wrong? Uh huh. And the, and the guy he beat the hometown guy, Purple Pants guy. Yeah. He's still over there up against the wall looking dejected. And I did say, boot him right in the five head about his five head. I maybe I shouldn't have said that. I'm thinking like, that guy looks genuinely sad. Was it my five head remark that got through the armor? Should I go buy him something from the concession stand? This is what I would call in the whole experience, the period of uncertainty. Yep. Yeah. And we were, we were trying to figure that out. But I think you're supposed to yell at the wrestlers to strike each other. I think so. I think you're supposed to egg them on. I think so. I'm like a hundred percent sure you're supposed to egg them on. But that, for whatever reason, Rico Gonzalez, when he turned and made eye contact with us and told us to shut our stupid mouths and that we don't know anything, all of us were like, you're right. We don't know anything. We're very sorry, which I think George said something like this, my buddy George, your buddy George. He said, your hero can only be as good as the bad guy is bad. Absolutely. Rule of storytelling. Yeah. And so we had our bad guy and like, we felt it like at that moment, like, but we kind of liked him. I liked him. Yeah. The whole time he was never my bad guy. I knew who I was supposed to root for. Tonya had the signs. The music told the story. Tune is in bright, fantastic, shiny, sparkly colors. He's wearing a singlet like an all American wrestler, like a guy you could relate to and believe in like that dude who lost his fingers in the snow when he was doing the American Olympic wrestling and everybody was like, guys name, I don't know, to Rudy Rupert. I have no idea what you're talking about. Really? There's this great big American wrestler and the Americans had never wanted wrestling since like the 1600s and he beat some guy in like the 94 Olympics or something and Rulon Gardner. Boom. There it is. Rulon Gardner. And then he went out in Yellowstone. His fingers froze off or something. Oh, wow. He's went through like all these ups and downs of life. And he's just, he's like Rudy. Like he's just the kind of guy where you're like, how can you not root for him? Well, we'll just a decent man. And that's how tune looks coming out. Like he's got real gentle eyes and like the kind of dude is big enough to handle his own, but my daughter described him as a teddy bear. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big teddy bear. But I really like the guy in black with the black beard and the black boots and the black get up and the black cape and the black mask. I was like, that guy, but he's cool. But when we said, like you remember, there was one point where we said, Hey, you, you turned us. We're cheering for you now. And what did he do in response to that? He turned around and said, stop. Yep. We're like, wait a second. Oh, sorry. We're back with tune, then. We hate you. I don't. It was interesting. It was very interesting. Yeah. But when that match started, you could tell it was a whole other athletic level. Yeah. A whole other level of risk. They knew their dance steps because before the match was even declared underway, Rico Gonzalez runs out, inverts his body and does a two footed dropkick to the chin and neck of the tune guy. He inverts himself and dropkicks his opponent in the first one second. And full athletic energy is right back up up on top of ropes before you even know what's happening. And it's coming down with a hip and a knee on his staggered opponent who then gets up. And I think he, I think some of it was genuine. He was he was raised. Yeah. And then he did, there was a move in the Nintendo entertainment system game called pro wrestling. I think Starman was the guy who could do it. Maybe I think it was Starman and it was the move nobody could ever pull off, but it was the most violent. It was called the backneck kick. It was the white whale. It was the holy grail of NES pro wrestling. And if you ever got it, what would happen is the guy would do like almost, what do you call it in soccer, a bicycle kick with the guy standing on his right and you do a bicycle kick and you catch him with your foot like wrapping around his neck and you get him in the base of the spine. And in the game, it would just stagger the dude and he would melt into the mat because it's like a spinal injury. Rico Gonzalez landed that Nintendo kick in real life within. It's the third movie did. It was in the first like 15 seconds of the match. And it hit him. I could hear boot on neck. Do you remember all of us looking at each other in that moment and saying, I'm not sure that was supposed to happen. I do remember. I mean, that could like pull your cervical vertebrae apart. I remember thinking, what just happened? This episode of notom questions is brought to you by Andrew McPherson. Destin, what do I mean by this? Yeah. So we did this little thing where we asked different people that support on Patreon at patreon.com slash notom questions. We said, Hey, why do you support the program? And we asked if they would send in some audio in Andrew McPherson. His name was drawn out of the figurative hat. And we're going to just listen to it. We haven't heard why he supports, but we're going to learn together. Does that work for you? Yeah, let's go blood oath covenant here. If this is awful, and he just makes fun of us the whole time with withering criticism, it stays. I think we got a roll with it either way. It stays. It's whatever happens here. This is happening. Yeah, you ready? Let's see what Andrew has to say. Let's do it. I'm excited. G'day, fellas, Andrew here. Thanks for making life better for me and my family of eight in the land down under. We started listening very early on and became winged to sars in 2019. My son Josiah put it best when he said it's nice to have something funny and formative and genuinely interesting to listen to while still being clean. Our favorite part so far have been anything barnacles and testicles, the red baron, Caesar, Miracles boner, Uranal Confessions, PV equals and sleep paralysis. We honestly love you guys. And if you ever in Queensland, Australia would be happy to have you around for a feat. Wow. Thank you, Andrew. That was unbelievably kind. And I really liked it when you said that you and your kids appreciate that it's clean. And then you said barnacles and testicles right after that. That's fantastic. No, I hit background music. Did you hear that? Like he produced that. Yes, I did. It was gorgeous. Yeah. And how do we have so many people who listen to this who have radio voice quality diction and enunciation that was lovely? Yeah, I know. Thank you so much, Andrew. That was fun. So if you want to support for any of the reasons that Andrew supports or your own reasons, that'd be great. And you can do that at patreon.com slash notum questions. Thanks, Andrew. Andrew and family. Thank you, a ton for liking this and being willing to vouch for us in front of people that is super kind of you. And thanks for making the podcast happen. Thanks for supporting the thing. And thanks, Josiah. I like your name. I have a question for you. Yes. Would you recommend if there's a father out there with a couple of young boys? Would you recommend he take his child to, let's say they're 12 and 14? Would you recommend a father to take his young boys to a wrestling match like that? I've been to one so I can only speak from the one I've seen. It's possible this was a total outlier and that our very presence changed the experience enough. You know, we were 5% of the audience and we were loud. So there's a lot of caveats here. But based on what I have seen, 36 hours ago, I don't know. Maybe I probably I wouldn't now. Yes. Absolutely. I would do it. Why first and for well, okay. You can't be more entertained than that for 20 bucks. Nobody was tempted to look at their phone. Think about that. That's not a throw away observation from you and me. Nobody was tempted to look at their phone. Yeah. Name anywhere. You're not tempted to look at your phone. Let's say you got cheap tickets to the opera. Are you going to check your phone? Yes. You are. Let's say that you get to go and hear some keynote speaker who's very interesting, but there's like five other speakers with him and you go to a really interesting conference for the day of things you're into. Do you check your phone that day? I do. Yeah. Do people check their phone when they listen to you speak at events? I'm sure. Yeah. I can see them checking even though they traveled to hear me talk about a thing. Okay. The phone is very interesting and I'm only marginally interesting and I'm not threatened. Are you saying I should start with that spandex when you talk? He talks. Obviously that's the take home. That's what this whole thing has been about. It's weird that you made us take so much time to get there. No, no, what I'm saying is I can't think of anything that people don't check their phones at. Baseball games, football games, movies, everybody checks their phone during movies. I can see it all the way down the theater. He's paid 20 bucks to get in here and you're checking your phone two or three times. Just kind of see what's up. Nobody did it. I didn't see it happen even once. I know. That's a big deal. It is. It's a big deal and that is worth noting. So that's reason number one. It was genuinely engaging and genuinely got me away from that stupid, accursed black mirror I carry around in my pocket. Reason number two, name a better exercise for reading the room. From what perspective? Dude, if a father were to take their 14 year old and 12 year old son to an event like that, one of the ways you got to set it up is guys, I don't even know what we're supposed to do here. I don't know how we're supposed to act. I don't know what you're supposed to say. But part of the fun of this is we're going to figure out what this event is and what this crowd is like tonight. And we're going to try to participate in a way that's fun for us and fun for others. That is a social exercise. You can't do that in a bubble. You have to read the room. Who's here? How are they acting? If it's a different room, we come off as mocking a thing that they love. But I don't think we did. I think we all had a lot of fun together, including the people we didn't know going in. And the wrestlers were reading the room. I bet they've got different vibes that they put out depending on what the crowd is like. And so every time you go, I mean, it's all schtick, but you also all paid 20 bucks. And everybody has goals and your integrity and character still matters. But to demonstrate proper integrity in this environment and proper character, you sort of need to mock the wrestlers or you're aloof and above it and not getting it. It's like the person who goes to the dance recital, but refuses to smile because I'm just not going to smile. Whoever smiles is doing it right. You're the one who's into it. You have to smile and participate and read the room. And I think it's a great exercise. I think there's a ton to break down about those little social dynamics. And on top of that, people in underwear kick each other in the face. It's true. I would say having done it, having taken kids to a wrestling match now, I would say it's super important to teach the story arc and explain that before going in. Well, maybe not, but I thought it was important. Well, walk me through them. Why do you think that? Well, Brandon walked us through it. He talked about you've got the face, you've got the heel, you've got the shine, okay, you've got the heat, you know, the shine being when you're invincible and the heat being when you're really, you know, getting attacked and everything's hurting and ultimately prevail. Once you understand story telling and you go into that, you can see, oh, well, this is why this is why this is working. This is why that man to my right, did you notice he had a holster for his dip? He had a leather, custom made holster. He did Copenhagen. He did. Yes. And he was holding a Milo's sweet tea. Yes. In the other hand, that was incredible. So when he got emotionally charged to the point where he stood up alone in the whole place, and he said, they don't want to wrestle you right now because they're chicken. Like, you know, they started that one match and the two guys ran away. Yeah. The reason that worked was carefully planned and executed and I think for my kids to understand like this is it's it's almost like rhetoric. You know, this is the I guess that would be the ethos part. Is that right? Yeah. I think it's important to understand what's happening so that you can protect yourself from being emotionally manipulated. I don't know, does sound dumb by saying that emotional. I don't understand what you mean in this context by emotionally manipulated. So I read hate incorporated by Matt Taiby, that which is sort of the twin episode to Brandon's locksmith wrestling episode. Right. And they deal with all the same themes, babyface, the heel, all of that. Right. And so by understanding these ways of having emotional influence over other people, you can protect yourself from falling victim to that. Right now, what we're in a time, as we sit here and record this, there's an incredible amount of military attacks taking place all over the world. Yes. And I'm looking at social media, and I'm seeing, you know, drone shots of crowds of people gathering in squares all over the world. And they're raising their hands and they're cheering, and they're waving their flag like you and I were waving the locks. And they're just yeah, and they're screaming like we were. But there's a difference. What is it? We had a suspension of disbelief because we understood the Dave is not the biggest man alive. He's actually not Matt. He's not the 65th percentile. Big Dave is not the biggest man alive. And so we could see that and we understood it, but we were participating for fun. There were people that didn't understand it the way we did. I'm not saying that we're Jesus because we understood that our tail wasn't attached. Okay, but let's break that down. You know what I'm saying. What's the time when you've been a flag waiver in a square or tempted to be duped in by the babyface and heel thing at an earlier point in your life to the point that you would stand up like Copenhagen holster guy and actually try to insert yourself into the mix. I mean, at the risk of sounding like an idiot, I think after 9-11, I think we all, there were very few people that were willing to say, hey, don't take away my privacy. I think everybody was ready to get revenge on whoever did this. I'm embarrassed to say that I watched, I watched our just the government surveillance program was born a new on that day. Because we forgot to think straight about it for like six months. Because we were that's all it took six months of I'm so mad. I don't care what it takes. All it took for me to forfeit my fourth amendment right to freedom from surveillance by my government without a warrant, without a due process to gain a warrant. And I'm never getting it back. I don't know. There's attempts, but I hope we do. It's I hope we do too, but but it's my fault is the point. Yeah, I was just barely old enough to vote at that point. And I saw things on the news that made me angry, justifiably so. And suddenly I did not care about the process of things. And I was metaphorically one of those flag waivers in the square. And now we know that those details were heavily cooked to get a certain reaction out of us. And I felt for it. Also, if you can have a conversation with a young person before going to something like that and say, Hey, here's what's going to happen. You're going to walk in and you're going to be told what to feel. There's going to be a person that holds a sign up and they tell you what's what side to pick. There's going to be a reduction in the number of acceptable ideas. We're going to simplify everything to one side or the other. And you you have to pick a side you either have to feel this you have to feel this there's no nuance here. If you could talk to a young person about, Hey, this is how this works. And you're going to see it happen. And and this is a metaphor for life. And it's going to it's going to play into bigger things as you go into adulthood. You're going to see people reduce the number of acceptable ideas that are possible in a conversation. Yes. Yeah. And the ring is metaphor for that. It is. The only thing we could be doing right now is we're watching this match is not have two people in spandex beat on each other inside the boundaries of this ring. Everything about this is an artificial construct. The ring, the event, the referee, the music, the referee who can I just for a minute? Yes. That guy was worthless. He never had control of that event. He was in attentive at one point. He got knocked out. Did you see that? Oh, he's just laying there. He might be dead. He no one even checked on him. Did you notice he was laying there? And then he vanished? Did you notice that? There just wasn't a ref anymore. Where did he go? Did you notice that he never said any actual words? No. Okay. So here's the deal. You mentioned this to me. And I am embarrassed to admit, I did not notice that. Oh, it's true. It's a thing. So tell me what you saw. Okay. I didn't see it. What do you what sound actually comes out of your mouth when you're driving and you make eye contact with someone else and you're trying to communicate to them that they can go through the stop sign first or whatever. Oh, he didn't do neighbor. Go ahead. Is that what you say? No, it's not what what actual sound if I was in the car with a microphone? What sound would I hear you make when you're talking to them? You're saying you I point at the we're all enclosed in our cars. Yeah. I wouldn't actually make a sound. I would just point at them be like, Hey, go ahead. I might talk out loud and say, go ahead. Yeah, you know, you first, but more often than not, I would just look at them. I would raise my eyebrows and make eye contact. And I would kind of eschew them on with my hand like, go ahead, you first. Yeah, you don't use words because they're far away. I'll tell you what I do. I don't say words. I mouth words, but it's the only time I don't make the sound is when I'm in a car. You know, where to stop light. Somebody makes a gesture like, is it okay if I, you know, change lanes in front of you? I'll give him the thumbs up and what I'm mouthing is you bet. Sure. Yes. Okay. But I don't make the sounds. I don't know why no one ever taught me to do that. That's what the ref was doing the whole time. See, he'd get into arguments with one of the tag team partners who conveniently could always get the ref to turn his back to the entire ring while some illegal shenanigans are going on. And the ref's over there, like wagging his finger in his face. I was just, but he's not, it's just watermelon, watermelon. He's not saying nothing. But what was so interesting is he was 10 feet from me and it never occurred to me that I could not hear the ref that did not occur to me once. That's funny. That just means like, yes, there was suspension of disbelief. But at the same time, there was stuff happening that I didn't understand. And so for me to sit here and pretend like, oh yeah, I've teach the kids to make sure that they understand everything that's going on. And then here I am, not even realizing the ref didn't talk. So I can still, I mean, it may be hubris to think that you're above it and able to see, oh, these people are being manipulated and I'm not. There's only two options. Yeah, exactly. Because clearly, I didn't see that. I guess let me just get right off this little high horse I'm on here and say, it was good for me to understand that these are the way these things work. And also be aware that some of it is possibly effective on me. Yes, of course, and me. This is the most obvious construct ever. These people were taking our tickets and they were sitting together. They were fine. They didn't hate each other. They were laughing about things. They were working together as a team to make sure everyone got seated in the right seats. But now they're spitting black oil in each other's faces and pronouncing curses from beyond upon them while wearing deer antler skull helmets. But come on, it's a construct. It's absurd. It's theater. It is ridiculousness. It's over the top. And we all know, and the only real question is, how do we find the dance steps and the social pace to participate so we can feel like we're a part of the construct yet to outsiders. When I look at other countries manipulating their people, it's a wrestling match, idiots. How can you not see what that party is doing to your country? How can you not see? And yet, here I am over here writing very important tweets and then deleting them at the last second because I tend to not do that. But oh, you can get me to be a flag waiver. You can get me worked up. You can tell me it's this guy in the purple spandex or it's that guy in the red spandex and you must pick. And if I'm not really paying attention, it'll work on me emotionally. And I will find a way to make my logic follow my emotional decision. I'll find a way to get my writer to agree with the decision the elephant made. It's so funny for as smart as I would like to imagine myself to be trying to be that I'm a sucker for the pro wrestling gimmick. I am too. I am manipulatable. I am too. What you just said, paraphrase is mine. I'm inclined to let my logic support my emotional decision. Is that what you said? That's what I said. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I enjoyed it, man. I thought it was really cool. Okay, but all right. Like all think he plays aside. That was ridiculously fun. Really was like, I can't think of many things in my life that should have not been fun that I am totally above that then completely blew away my expectations of fun. And I found myself with no alcohol. I had a Chick-fil-A sandwich. That was all that was in my system. I was all in. It wildly surpassed my expectations. And I'm grateful to every one of those people for making a super fun night for all of us. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I would like to close the loop on one thing. Afterwards, we went up and we of course we saw the locksmith Brandon. We took pictures with him. That was great. He asked for the lot. He's like, hey, dude, can I have one of these locks? How would you like all three of them? So we gave him the locks and I was embarrassed to say, man, we spent like five minutes making these. I can get you more locks. If you need more locks, maybe you can. Yeah. But the one thing that was very important that we needed to close the loop on is after the wrestling match, we went and talked to Big Dave. Yes, we did. After everything was shut down, Big Dave was there. And we said, hey, Big Dave, that was great, man. And we just talked to him. And we talked to Brandon. And we said, Brandon, were we doing it right? Like we were concerned, like, were we actually cheering correctly? And he said, dude, you did it perfect. Thank you. It meant so much that you came and did that. And that was great. But I did ask Big Dave a question. I said, hey, Big Dave, I'm going to level with you, buddy. I was uncomfortable with how loose your briefs were. Like, I was worried a couple of times those things might come off. And I did not, I did not, I felt like there was going to be a little pop, a little wardrobe malfunction at some point. It looked like he may be sat in some gum or something. Absolutely. I was afraid. Yeah. And he said, well, here's the thing, man. I think you actually heard him say it. What did he say? He said, he used to, I used to, when I started out was 320 pounds. Oh, that's the Big Dave thing. Okay, I get it. You know, I've dropped some weight doing this and I probably need to get some new drawers. Wait, you're probably what? 205 right now? You didn't drop a few pounds, man. You dropped a person in weight and you're still wearing the same trousers. Yeah, it might be time to spring for some fresh trousers. Can I give you money? I didn't think to offer, but we should just buy Big Dave trousers and just mail them to them and don't say anything. Surely we can find out how to get ahold of Big Dave. We can figure this out. Yeah, I have one request. Okay. Obviously, we took some cell phone footage of this. Obviously, we did. Yeah. With your permission, can I put some of the cell phone footage over on the Patreon page, patreon.com slash notom. Is notom questions? That's it. Patreon. Yeah, no, we've talked a lot about social dance steps in this conversation. And socially, the thing that I think I'm supposed to say is like, yeah, you bet. But then you ask permission. So whatever happens, I had a chance to say no. But I think we need to make a blood of covenant with each other and decide what the terms of this are going to be because a lot of crap happened there at that wrestling match last night. Oh, we yelled a lot of things. I made a lot of chicken gestures, various types. I see. I did. Oh, you want a chicken a blood of covenant with the patrons? No, I want to make it with you. Okay. If we're publishing things, no, not publishing. No, I mean, if we're sharing them with patrons. Yeah, but not publishing. Not publishing. Just sharing with the patrons. Yes. If we're doing this, I think no matter how humiliating the video is for either of us, the given clip up it goes. I think no protecting dignity. I don't want to do that. I don't like this idea. Hey, the event was what the event was. I don't like your terms. Come a counter proposal. Well, I mean, like we have potentially career destroying things that we could be. What did you say? I'm joking. I'd say nothing. I mean, I said it that I was afraid that it would look like big Dave sat in some gum. What is what is your favorite thing? I remember my favorite thing I yelled the whole night. What was it? When the guy has Brandon locked up and I just screamed, you can't lock up the locksmith. That was glorious. And everybody echoed it. Everybody was like, yeah, you can't do that. Is he sad? I did somebody else near me just screams out. He's got the key. Yeah. I don't even know who I will upload that video. That's the video I will. Okay. That's fair. Yeah. Yeah. What was your favorite thing you said? You said, dude, I said a lot of crap. They were there were a lot of things that I said. I tried to make them sneaky so people wouldn't know where they were coming from. Did we capture you saying, you got to reverse it or use your other arm? I don't know because I started crying after that. I need to find out. Use your other arms. My favorite thing that I said, it made me cry because I thought I was yelling it in a cacophony of noise and it just went quiet and use your other arm. Big Dave. Oh crap. Big Dave looks at me. The other guy looks at me like, don't do. Don't tell him to use his other arm. I know. And I just went straight into my Colorado avalanche hoodie. You did. You pulled it over your head and you kneeled down in the aisle.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.0, "text": " Music", "tokens": [50363, 7849, 50763], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.272823918949474, "compression_ratio": 1.4830917874396135, "no_speech_prob": 0.029872452840209007}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 8.0, "end": 10.0, "text": " So, what'd you think about wrestling last night?", "tokens": [50763, 1406, 11, 644, 1549, 345, 892, 546, 16381, 938, 1755, 30, 50863], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.272823918949474, "compression_ratio": 1.4830917874396135, "no_speech_prob": 0.029872452840209007}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 10.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " My face hurts.
