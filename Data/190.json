I still feel pretty clever about that one. Yeah, the math one I saw it do doing some math hacks on the Internet and I've never thought about before and I thought I bet there were probably a lot more math hacks than that. And since I'm a math hack in a different sense of the word hack, I thought it'd be fun to learn about tricks and haven't put together tricks for me and then you would teach me math trick. Okay, well, I didn't really do that, but I kind of did something better, I think. I would like to introduce you to Dr. Kevin, you know, math professor at Pepperdine University. Hi, how are you doing? I'm doing super and I happen to know Dr. Kevin, you know, mathematics professor at Pepperdine University and think rather highly of him. Let me tell you how Matthew, Dr. Egan is Matt. He's sitting here wearing a shirt in front of me that says God said and then a bunch of equations and it says let there be a lot and there was light. Is that what it says? Yeah, and there was light. Yep. And those are Maxwell's equations. Yeah, that's right. That predicts the existence of light. It's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. So Matt, what were you hoping for in a math episode to be totally transparent here? Kevin, you have how much time before you have to leave for the airport? Maybe about half an hour ish. Yeah. Oh, wow. Okay. Well, no dinking around out on the front end. I was going to do all this stuff about like, Hey, doesn't weird out live right by Pepperdine and isn't he part of like some church. I heard where I'll teach a Sunday school at the church there on campus. But the fuck about weird out for a long time. Now, does he really fall of that? Actually, Hollywood church of Christ, not the campus church of Christ, but yeah, same domination just down the road. Really? Oh, I didn't know that. I knew it. I knew there was some kind of weird out thing. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Yeah, I had a buddy who went to Pepperdine. He's like, weird out with my Sunday school teacher. What? Are you serious? What a Pepperdine of weird out because my Sunday school teacher. So I went to visit Kevin at Pepperdine and I've got to say that's one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever been to in my entire life. Oh, yeah. Is that where you're there? Yeah, it's been really great. Actually, like, yeah, the campus is great. The community is even better. What do you mean? Yeah, you know, it's a kind of thing where if you're there for a long time, you kind of forget that other places aren't at school. And until people come and say, wow, this is a wonderful place and you use them around and yeah, and then the community comes together. And actually, the best place to see community is when things are tough. Last year, we lost four students to a car crash. That was really tough on everybody, but it was really beautiful to see the community come together at that moment as well. So how big is this in a body? Oh, I have to look it up undergrad. I would say there's about 3000. We also have some graduate programs, but it's harder to count those because not everybody's full time. Depends on how you how you measure that. Yeah, I've only ever seen it from the road. I've driven by a couple of times and it was red. Yeah. Okay, but I said I wasn't going to do that. So we didn't do that and that doesn't count. Weird out. Okay, so the math thing. That was your question. What did I envision? What I envisioned was this. I imagined that you destined would ask me a question and it would be something like this. Well, Matt, when I give you the following problem, how would you attack that in your brain? And then I would think for a minute and I would describe to you my mental process and then you would try to be polite, but deep down, you'd be like, that's a very bad way to come at it because I'm not good at the math. But you would very gently be like, that's great. But here's maybe another thing that you could do and this would make you better at math on the fly. And then I would learn and then everybody in the third chair would be like, yeah, I totally already knew that even if you found there wouldn't already total no all of that and it would make them better at math too. That's how I imagine the episode. Well, let me just full disclosure. Let me tell you how I met Kevin. So he emailed me and we went back and forth a little bit and then we had lunch together and we found that we had similar interests. And then I had to take a mega math test. I'll call it is called the PhD preliminary exam. And do you remember me preparing for that exam, Matt? You remember how not cool I was to be around? Do you remember that I suffer from nail pattern baldness? Okay. Yeah. So I was it. I was if you remember that than that, I probably just about as much. Remember what it was like for you warming up for that exam. It was not. It was not good. Yes, my friend. I remember vividly. You were pretty pleasant at times during that. It was pretty hard. And so I'm not going to go into all the things of the exam, but Kevin volunteered to help me with that exam. I'm talking like over Zoom sessions. He was teaching me how to solve partial differential equations with the Frobenius method and like separation of variables. All these things. He spent a lot of time and just volunteered. Nobody knows he did that. It was just completely. I mean, yeah, I really appreciate it, Kevin. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you. That was fun. Yeah. So he's the man is my point, Matt. He's the guy that's going to ask these questions because he did that to me during this exam. He was trying to explain everything to me and he did it in a way that I could understand. So I was Kevin, do you have an interesting math things that you could talk about with us? Sure. Let's start with this one. Matt pick up. I don't know. Like say, four digit number. Tell me what number you picked. 3,511. 3,511. Okay. Dustin, is that a multiple of nine? Of nine? Yeah. No, it's got 11 at the end. That feels very prime number. What was the 3,511? 3,511. Let me divide it by nine. Let's see. It's not. Yeah, that's not. It's not. So do you know how to figure that out without pulling up a calculator or, you know, spending a bunch of time on pencil and paper? I don't. I had to punch it into a calculator. So you're saying there's a way of a three trick. What's that? All of the digits to make up a number add up to something that is visible by three. It's visible by three. Is that how it works? Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't know if that would work for nine as well. So yeah, I'm up one plus one plus five plus three. I got to 10 and I thought, what? That doesn't seem like it would work for the three. So I bet it would work for the nine. So my guess was no. Matt, hold on. You're not supposed to be teaching me stuff in this episode. I didn't know that you add the digits up. And if if they are multiple of three, the whole thing's divisible by three. Is that how it works? I think so, but I'm going to defer to Dr. Kevin Eagle from Pepperdine University. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's right. So actually, yes, it works for three and it works for nine. It doesn't work for any other number, but it works for three and it works for nine. Really? Yeah. And the way you think about this is if you want to know if something's a multiple of nine, well, I want you to imagine a clock, but instead of having 12 hours in the day, so in clock, it goes one, two, three, four, and goes all the 12 and then it repeats, right? Yeah. Instead, let's make it go up to nine. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and then it goes back to one. I don't like that. So the first 33% of the clock goes to three. Is that correct? Right. And then the second two thirds of it goes to six and then the rest goes to nine. Okay. That's right. So I'm imagining a piece sign. Yeah. It's a piece sign. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So now, if you kind of think about what's going on with with a number like 3,511, well, let's start with 11 just to make things easier. So 11, is that a multiple of nine? Well, no. But let's see if we can see it. Well, 11 is 10 plus one, right? That's what 11 means. Mm-hmm. And so 10 in the nine, nine hour clock is the same as one, right? Yeah. So instead of 11, that is 10 plus one, I can think of it as the first 10, turn it into a one. So 10 plus one becomes one plus one. Okay. Yep. Yep. So in fact, as far as the nine hour clock is concerned, 11 is the same as one plus one or two. Yes. Now let's take another two digit number. Um, just in this time, you pick a two digit number. Uh, 37, which is the number that everybody always picks. Yeah. 37. So 37 is three times 10 plus seven, right? That's what it means. Yes. And on a nine hour clock, 10 is the same as one. Hold on. You're going fast. Is he going fast? Do you matter? Is he just going fast to me? I'm feeling my mind warming up. Okay. I'm making a lot of agreement sounds, but they're not maybe dull, totally honest. Okay. Hold on. Wait, say it again now. So 37 is three times 10. Okay. Plus seven. Got it. Yeah. So sure. 10, we already established 10 in the nine nine hour clock is the same as one. Yeah. Yeah. So I've got this little dial in my head that's just buzzing around. Okay. Okay. It goes around, around, around, and then it goes one more. Right. Okay. I see. So 10 is going around once on the nine hour clock. And then one more. Okay. Got it. So instead of going three times 10, I can go three times one, right? Hold on. If I only care about how far it is on the nine o'clock, nine hour clock. Right. Okay. Yes. Now, it just clicked right there. Right. Doesn't matter how many times we go around because we're going to end up in the same place on the wheel. Right. So instead of going three times 10 plus seven, I can go three times one plus seven. Okay. In other words, just add three plus seven. Yes. Okay. Okay. I see it. The same thing works with 100. 100 is just 10 tens, which is just turn 10 to one. 10 times 10 becomes one one. So it's one times one. 100 is also one. I see on the clock on the nine o'clock clock. Yeah. Nine hour clock. And a thousand, likewise, it's also going to be a one. Okay. And that's just because we're base 10. Got it. Right. And so whenever I write any number in base 10, I can take each of the digits and just add them all up. And that will be the same on the nine o'clock clock, nine hour clock as the number itself. Okay. So Dr. Ega, would you prefer Dr. E of Kevin? Either way. Yeah. Come, Kevin. Kevin. All right. So give me a number and I would like to try to tell you if it's divisible by nine. Okay. Let's go with 57. 57. So that's 12. And 12 is not divisible by nine. Right. The nine hour clock. That would be nine. It'd be like 10, 11. It'd be like three o'clock on the nine o'clock. And nine hour clock, right? That's right. That's right. So it's not divisible by nine. However, it is divisible by three. That's right. Whoa. Okay. Matt, you want to try one? I guess you already did the original one. No, I'm in trouble. Okay. So I had the three tricks, but I didn't feel whoa. When you said that, I didn't feel that at all. I felt, uh, which is a very different emotion. Right. So I knew that 57 wasn't divided by nine because of knowledge. Right. I just knew. I just knew that it wasn't. Okay. So let's try slightly bigger number than 57 then. Um, try 300, 321. Three hundred and twenty one. Well, that is definitely divisible by three. Yep. Because the sum of the digits. Six divisible by three. So that's great. But I'm not understanding the trick for translating this to nine. Just do the same thing. Just see if it's divisible by nine. What do you mean? Like the sum of the digits? Yep. Yep. Well, six isn't divisible by nine. There we go. So it's not divisible by nine. Seriously. Yeah. That's very clear. Yep. Why was acting like this was hard? Yeah. This was for three divisible by three. This has for this works for if it's divisible by nine. The other one that's like it is not quite the same divisible by eleven. For that you have to add every other digit and subtract every other one. Whoa. Hold on. Okay. Hang on. No, no, no, no, no more. Okay. Seventy four thousand two hundred and twenty four. Hold on. My number. Seventy four thousand two hundred and twenty four. Okay. Two to four. So that's eight. Okay. Now plus seventy four eight plus eleven. So what do we do? Every other digit and you add some track. So seventy four thousand means add seven subtract four. Yeah. Okay. Got it. And then add. Add two. Add two. And then I take two away. Take two away. Add four. Right. Okay. Seven. Now what happened? So we asked, is that a little of eleven? Heck no. No, no, no, no, no. You said was not divisible by seven. So, wow. Dude, this, this is Matt. If you've ever eaten lunch with Kevin, this is how it works. You just have a couple of little like, oh, how's it going? Yeah. I think that's neat. Do you think I think that's great? Let's drill to the core of the earth in this philosophical topic. That's what every lunch I've ever had with Kevin is like. I love it. So you're saying you take it. Wait a second. So all we have to do is just drop. If we drop the seven and run the same number 42 24, this is going to work. Because it's four. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yep. You're right. The second one is four. Two. Two. Four is a multiple of eleven. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Four. So that's four minus two is two plus two is four minus four is zero. Is that right? Yeah. And so that's a multiple of eleven. Try it in your calculator. All right. Calculating one second. Calculating for total for divided by eleven. Three eighty four. Matt Whitman, you just figured that out. I'm proud of you. I don't know that I did. I don't know that I got there the same way you did. Now I'm concerned. We need to run another number. All right. Let's get us another number. It's going to be thirty six thousand and five thirty six thousand and five. Okay. I get this one. So three minus six is minus three plus zero minus zero plus five minus three plus five is two. Not visible by eleven. No. There we go. Thirty six is zero zero five divided by eleven. Checking the math. No, not visible by five. Wow. Is this how the savants do it? I've seen a bunch of savants on like videos and stuff. They'll say all this crazy stuff. And is this how they're what they're doing? I don't know what they're doing. You have, I guess you'd have to have them on the podcast to tell you. But this is a trick. The trick only works for a couple of numbers like this, but I would say you go to a magic show and they're playing with numbers and they're asking people to do stuff. Eighty percent of the time something like this is involved. Okay. My guess. This is just kind of really handy kind of thing that you can do in a lot of these magic tricks to force people to choose a particular letter of the alphabet or or something like that. Hey, is it okay if we jump on real quick here and tell people about the thing you've been working on? Yeah, that'd be awesome. It's my understanding that you've been doing the 10 minute Bible hour podcast for a long time. And I guess it was about a year or more ago you went through every book of the Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus all the way through. And you were making videos out of those episodes. Is that right? Yeah, more or less. Yeah, it's not exactly the same audio. You know, I'm playing with it to make it make more sense for the video stuff. But yeah, that's basically it. Are you going to put this on your YouTube channel or just going to go somewhere else? Have you figured that out? For now, I was going to put it on my YouTube channel and see what happens. I mean, it's a channel where I've talked about the Bible for a long time. So I think it ought to work. You've put like a tremendous amount of money and effort into this, right? Because you've like hired graphic design people and you're investing in this. Dude, this is the hardest I've ever tried. Probably at anything ever to be kind of honest. Are you scared? Yes, you know I am. I mean, you're smart. You know what different people who make things on YouTube do. And you know that my vibe has always been kind of this heave the bowling ball down the alley. It's going to bang against all of the kid bumpers all the way down. It's going to knock down some pins by the end. It'll be all right. And the sort of the slip shot goofy, sometimes intentionally bad production is sort of part of the fun and the style of it. I still want it to feel like that, but I want it to feel like that. And I'm also trying really hard. And I roped in a couple of really skillful people to help me. And so now it's like, oh, dang, now everybody's going to know I'm trying. And so now, yeah, a little nervous. You're nervous because you're trying. Yes, I mean, I try on all of it, but this is different. I think the Bible came from God. And I know that that's not everybody thinks that. But I think that I think that. Yeah, I know. I don't want to embarrass him by making a crappy bunch of videos about his book that he made. No, I just wanted to come on here and talk about it because I know you're scared. And I know how much effort I think. I think the first draft I saw of this was over six months ago, right? The first draft you saw was 11 months ago. Yeah. So I know you're scared and I'm not being sarcastic about that. Like you have reason to be scared. You've invested a tremendous amount of time, talent, energy, effort. And let's just say it, man, the algorithm's not going to like it. You know, you're making stuff about the Bible. The algorithm's not going to like it. You're not going to get a sensational algorithm to promote that. So I think you just have to be aware that you're going to put it out there. The joke that you and I always make with microphones off is the video that would really perform is how many nuns does it take to stop a 50-cal bullet? That was orphans. Orphans. Oh, it was orphans. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. The more sensationalistic, the more the algorithm likes it, even if it's because of important things. Yes. Exactly. That's the punchline. That is the punchline. Part of the reason that I'm nervous about this is that I didn't totally make the video for people who are already sympathetic to the Bible. Yeah. I tried really, really, really hard to tap into my skepticism, my questions, a long period of time that I went through in my own life of not really being on firm footing in terms of what I believe about God or about anything. I know what it's like to come at the Bible like that. And I tried to, is this making sense? I tried to take that person into account and not just make it for the home team. Yeah. Absolutely. I'm especially concerned that the algorithm will not know what to do with it or who it's for. But that's my swing. That's what I'm trying to do. You've worked for over a year on this first video, which is Genesis. So what's the plan moving forward? Are you going to start rolling out other ones? I really like, by the way, I really like the way you've, you stylized it with photos of you and color. People will just have to figure out what I'm talking about later. I think that's cool. But what's your plan? Are you going to roll that out for Exodus next or how long you think it's going to take? It's not going to take another year because clearly you built the system. No, I know. We got a good chunk done on Exodus already. But my plan is that we will mill around in Genesis for a little while. So there'll be one main video that is just trying to explain what is in this ancient book and what does it mean? And then you do with it whatever you want. It's a really good understandable for normal people summary of what is in there with no instruction for what to do. It's not a sermon. It's educational. Yeah. And then there's going to be a shorter version of this Genesis video that is totally, it's different words, it's different images. And this one just sort of focuses on the theme and it's much shorter, like maybe four minutes. When you say shorter, I mean, are you playing the shorts game with this stuff too? Are you going to roll shorts out? I am. Yeah. Okay. But it's not just going to be different iterations of the same thing. There are little vignettes and little nuggets that it works really well to pinch zoom in on real fast, 20 seconds, 40 seconds. And what I found is that shorts right now on YouTube, that's the best way in the world to get outside of your own little algorithmic bubble and talk with people who aren't like you. Who don't think the same things as you. Who don't click on the same things as you. And so if you want to have a conversation with somebody from a completely different tribe, shorts are a good way to do it. You just keep making good shorts and firing them off. And it seems like that's where I'm meeting the most people who aren't like me on the internet. So I've got right now six little sub 60 second vertical shorts that I'm going to try out with this as well. So there's one main video and then short video, a handful of literal shorts that I'm just going to try to use to see if I can connect with different people. More power to me, man. I'm still anti shorts. I don't like them. But maybe it's just because of the way I do things. I don't think they make sense for what you do. I don't think so. I don't think strategically there's any advantage for what you do. But you're trying to find anybody out there, no matter how short their attention span is. I think it makes sense for this, for what you're doing. I'm trying to find people even who don't have any interest in believing or in God or thinking there's anything to the Bible. But they're highly empathetic and they have people in their lives who do highly value the Bible. They're Christians. And they would like to understand what they think better. And so I've kind of crafted some of these shorts to try to connect with that crowd. They're like, hey, you can learn more about what these people in your life who you care about, think and believe and what your neighbors believe without having to really sign up for anything. So, okay, you're about to launch it tomorrow. Is that right? That's my hope. Where do people go see it on your YouTube channel? Yep. Yep. The YouTube channel is Matt Whitman in the 10 minute Bible hour. Or, you know, just search my name. It always comes up. Okay. Sounds good. Well, looking forward to it. You will get at least a view from me, my friend. I will view it. Yeah. So, for my mom, that is two. That's right. Now, I'm looking forward to it. I know you've worked really hard on this. That was why I first reached out to you because I could tell you were doing a thing and you didn't care how it performed. Like the very, very first time I called you and you ignored me was I could tell you were working hard on a thing even though it wasn't performing super well in the algorithm. But you were being faithful and continuing to do it. It's fun to see you on this side of that equation. Like you nervous about it, you know, because I didn't get to meet that version of you. You know what I mean? Well, this is the first time I'm meeting this version of me. Oh, yeah? You think so? Yeah. I just felt this way before. Well, I'm looking forward to it. So go check out the Genesis video and do you know what you're going to call it yet? Genesis, colon, what's in it and what does it mean? You haven't decided yet. I haven't decided. Genesis, colon, lightning summary. Genesis, something's summarized. Something. Yeah. My recommendation is the first two hours it's going. You just keep changing it and you figure out what gets the most clicks and just stick with that. That's my recommendation. That's the game. I'm going to do it. I think it's Genesis, colon. How many orphans does it take to summon it to get? Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to get clicks. I think the non's is funny. All right, buddy. I'm excited for you. It's been a long time coming. So I'm looking forward to seeing it. And I hope everybody in the third chair checks it out. Thanks, man. What else do you have? You had other tricks like this? Yeah, this may be not a trick, but here's a question. Let's say somebody says, all right, I want to get a square on your floor. You're going to design something for you. It's going to design something for your floor and it should be a two by two square. So it's going to be an area for right. So it's two feet by two feet areas, four square feet. All right. And you work very hard and you go to your go to your smart every day place and you know, you have some questions lab. You cut out a square like this and it's a two foot by two foot square. And while you're at it, you make a whole bunch of them because, you know, you're not going to just have one. You're going to fill the floor with this thing in sort of this bathroom tile kind of way. You got the picture. You're filling your bathroom floor with these square tiles, each size four square feet. Right. Got it, Matt. Yeah, sure. This seems very straightforward so far. All right. Now, actually, you look back in notes and you realize, Oh, actually, I made a mistake. I don't want something of four square feet. I want something of eight square feet. And you've already made all this these tiles, right? And you're like, Oh, my goodness, I screwed it all up. Well, here's a question. Is there something you could do to get a square of area eight square feet from what you did? Now, there's lots of things you could do, of course, but, you know, just style and brainstorming. What, um, it has to be a square. Yeah, it has to be a square. And it's going to be an area eight. Okay. So we got two foot by two foot. Yep. Four square foot squares. Yep. And you're telling me that you want me without making any more cuts to align these in such a way that they would give me eight square foot squares. Um, what I want is to be able to draw a square of area eight, eight square feet on that grid. Oh, my, I'm thinking. Okay. Well, nine square feet is very easy. Yes. Four square feet is very easy. Sixteen square feet is very easy. So for 16 square feet, how would you do that? I would just double everything. Right. Double everything. Right. And if you move my boxes next to each other and I've heard before, total boxes, instead of in one box, you have to get a 15. Right. Now, here's the thing with what the problem that you're running into is when you double the length, what happens to the area? It quadruples. It quadruples, right? This is kind of not what we want. We want the area to double. Hold on. That's working on this over lunch. Yeah. This is crazy. Literally. Okay. No, let me explain this another way, my friends. So today I got lunch with my friend Austin, who owns Armadillo's ice cream shop in downtown Rapid City. It's a lovely place. Yeah. Austin got three bids for three different types of umbrellas to help provide shade to his customers. We spent lunch trying to figure out which would be the most cost efficient and which most provide shade for customers. The various increments are similar to what we're talking about. And what we were having to figure out is how much would we have to stretch this proposed umbrella to double the square footage of shade that would be created by it. I literally just had to get a solid move on lunch immediately before we got on this call. And you'll be proud to know I did not figure out how to do it. Well, I'm going to take a stab at it. So if I have a unit square, the hypotenuse is square root of two. Right. So one by one, if I draw a diagonal angle from corner to corner, it's square root of two. And so I feel like if we were to turn the squares 45 degrees and start stacking things in there so that's, I feel like we cut them on diagonals or something. That's exactly right. You got it. You got it. But I don't know how to do it. Yeah. So let's unpack a little bit of what's going on here. How do you cut the umbrella? So he started with this grid of two by two squares. Right. Yeah. The four by four ones actually kind of useful. Imagine you had the four by four. And that's made up of a bunch of two by two squares, actually four of those. Right. When the upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. What I want you to do is make a diamond. You're going to start from the top of the middle of the top of your four by four square, then go diagonally to the left in the middle of the left side. Oh, we cut the corners off each square. Yes. Ah, and you go from there to the bottom, the middle of the bottom edge, then to the middle of the right edge and back to the middle of the top edge. And that makes a diamond, right? Yes. But that's actually a square. It is. And so now the hypotenuse of each one is still one. Is that right? Well, you don't have to measure the hypothesis. You don't need to use Pythagorean theorem. All you need to do is notice this. Look at the upper left. Right, right, right, right. All you need to do is look at this. The upper left two by two square, you cut that in half, right? You just cut it like diagonally, like you might tune a sandwich. Okay. And so the amount that's in your diamond is half of what you had. Likewise, for the lower left, you cut diagonally and the part that you're going to keep is half of the total. There you go. And the one on the upper right and the bottom of that same thing, you've gotten half of your 16. Got it. And then you just use those little inner squares. Yeah. This is the math that goes into making mosaic. Yeah. This is how you get your dimensions right. This is how you mark out your scale, whether you're a chalk line or whatever. And you cut from squares to get the proportion that you want. Oh, man. Oh, gosh, that makes so much sense. And I was intimidated when you're like, well, you're going to have to run the Pythagorean theorem. Well, I mean, probably somebody knows up top their head, but square root two is. Yeah. So Matt, do you like Plato? Plato's dog. The enjoyable child substance promoting or the philosopher. The philosopher in the golden age of Greek philosophy. Yeah. In the summer. I am right now holding my Alexander the Great Coin in my hand. Alexander Great was tutored by Aristotle. He was tutored by Plato. Got it like I got a connection with him right here in my hand. Good. Look up, Meno, M-E-N-O dialogue with Meno in the middle. Okay. Yeah. He has a boy come and they're discussing how do we learn things and he bring this boy up and they asked this exact question that I've asked you and walks the boy through this through the argument that I just gave you. We're talking ancient Greece doing exactly what we just did. Really? Yes. And this is, yeah, that's interesting. So when you think of math, Kevin, do you think more of just numbers and how things line up on grids and stuff? Or do you think philosophically about it? Or do you think geometrically? How does your brain work? All the above. When you're working on a math problem that you don't know how to solve, you've got to kind of pull everything. Sometimes you're dealing with numbers and you say, okay, well, I know how to deal with numbers and you work with that. Sometimes you're dealing with geometric things and you try to pull up your geometric intuition of what's going on. A lot of it though, once you start doing college level and graduate level math major stuff, you're thinking about big ideas and you're thinking, okay, why is this true? And you're thinking, well, if this is true here, how does that apply there? And that's a lot of what math is. Math originally, we studied numbers, counting things. We got three apples, five stones, and as well as geometry, we're going to measure this building here, trying to build a pyramid. It was very early on understood that these two things are two sides of the same coin, but since then, people have been thinking about the mathematics of symmetry, the mathematics of tiling, the mathematics of games, the mathematics of economic exchanges, a lot of different areas that tie into math. And so math is not just about counting things and not just about geometric figures. It's about a lot of different things that have a lot of structure that you can study on an abstract level. So let me mention that this problem could go on with the problem that I just gave you about finding the square of area eight. You could ask, okay, what size can make a size of a big enough square so that square that's double the size that that side length, you want maybe that to have a whole number of, be a whole number, right? So we had a square of area four that had side length two. We had square of area nine that had side length three, square of area 16, had square, had length four. But these diagonal ones, those were not whole numbers. Can we get one that is a whole number? And the Pythagorean's ancient Greek cult, basically vegetarian cult, thought a lot about number. And according to their ideas, numbers measured length and numbers as far as they were concerned were whole numbers. Hold on. I thought there was a guy named Pythagoras. Probably. Wait, wait, hold on. You're saying it was a cult? Yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a whole, well, maybe we would call it maybe a cult today. It was a group of people who followed Pythagoras. Supposedly, we don't have very many of their writings. They're a secret organization. They kind of start up in the Greek islands around Samus. And eventually you have to move to an area of southern Italy called Protona. But most of what we know about them is by other people because they were secretive. You see, so they didn't, they wouldn't share anything with what they knew. Man, I want your response to that. I'm just grinning, man. I don't know if you can hear me like I'm making smile sounds on accident. This is fantastic. You asked Dr. Kevin Eager a question about what this all means, which made me very happy that you asked me because of the fact that you did. Yeah. And so Socrates, I mean, I haven't read it, but I know what Socrates is driving that. He's driving at natural ethics, natural morality. He's making the point that if you can reason to this solution, you can reason to what is right, what is virtuous, what is noble because that was the end game of all of Socrates reasoning. Right. And you're taking it right into it. And I have to take this call from the plumber. Continue. No, no, no, wait, Matt, you there? I have to. Yeah. Kevin has to go get on a plane, man. Matt went to pull. All right. So I'm going to end the episode with you, Kevin. All right. I guess this is just going to be a math teaser. Yep. Yeah, because we're not going to be able to go any further today, but you were here. And I was like, man, we got to do something. So yeah, that was fun. This is literally a math teaser because it's going to be a short episode. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe we'll make it. I don't know. Maybe. Right. Who knows? Thank you so much to everybody that supports this podcast at patreon.com slash note of questions. We're grateful. And we asked a few patrons to record a little blurb about why they choose to support at patreon.com slash note of questions in hopes of just letting you see what it's like and see, you know, how it makes them feel. So we'd like to play one of those for you now. Hi, I'm Kerrigan and I'm Toby and we're from Waukesha, Wisconsin. We started listening to the podcast because I love Smarter Every Day. So I was like, Hey, cool. Dustin's doing a podcast. Who's this map guy? I wouldn't you know it. Matt is my spirit animal. So I stuck around and dragged my wife into it too. And we've been patrons since just before the 2017 eclipse. We started supporting so we could come to the meetup in Wyoming, but we kept supporting all this time because we want more of this kind of thing to exist in the world. We love the conversational mutual education that happens here. We learn stuff from you guys all the time and love how you model a curious posture toward the world. Thanks for everything. Thanks. Are you so there, Matt? I'm back. Hey, Matt, Dr. Ega has to leave. So I propose we just make this a little math teaser. Like this could be very short, but I mean, he's got to like, he's got to get on a plane. Okay. Final question. You can answer it quickly. Yep. Do you think that Socrates is right and that math points towards some sort of virtue? Does math have anything to do with character? I don't know. I think that math points to something that is beyond our universe, that our universe is built on things that are basically math. And so that says that math is something that is beyond what we normally would see as scientific or the physical world. And if you can do that, then that raises the question as to whether or other things like ethics might be also. I would say that we have been properly. He's just going to drop that. It's really hard to leave. And we buy you a different flight. So what if we, what if we pick this up another time? Wow. Yeah, no big deal. I just dropped the deepest thing I've ever heard anybody say. Not a big deal. Yeah, in your shirt. Your shirt has a, yeah, a reference to shirt again. God said, and then the Maxwell's equations and there was light. That's so fun. All right. Well, Dr. Eager, thank you so much for being here. Matt. Thank you. Matt, you want to land the plane for us? There's no plane to be landed. What he said is going to make everyone in the third chair and the new thing for a long time. So we'll just thank. Thanks, Kevin. All right. Thank you. Cool. Appreciate it, man.
