So my understanding is something was found in Coomron. Uh, uh, like that. Yes, you were in the zip code, a little bit south of Coomron, but yeah, there was a discovery and it was a big deal. Did you see it in the news or anything? Yeah, I did, but I decided to wait. I know you even put a video out about it, decided not to watch it. So my understanding is they found something in what they call the cave of horrors where they do the Dead Sea Scroll research, right? Doesn't that sound good? Yeah, cave of horrors sounds like an Indiana Jones movie. So so it's my understanding that they found something and I believe the quote was when I understand my brain will melt out of my ear. Is that, is that what you said? I think that's a, no, I have to deliver on that. I think it's really cool. So the summary is this. The Dead Sea Scrolls refers not just to the scrolls that were initially found in those troves in the caves around Coomron, which is up north on the north end of the Dead Sea. And there they of course famously found this cult, this sect of Judaism had tucked away all of their scriptures, all of this commentary literature on what they regarded as scripture. And even a treasure hunt scroll about where they hid maybe a bunch of golden silver and things like that. The copper as well as some, the copper, good memory. Yes. Yeah. As, as well as some calendar texts about how they render time and some rules about how they conduct business and do ceremonial washing and stuff like that. So we get this time capsule that's discovered in the mid 20th century that gives us this window into almost a completely lost group of people, the lost little civilization, little culture. And it was amazing on a ton of different levels, Bible and theology, which is my world being one of them. But then since then, we have found all up and down the western side of the Dead Sea, these little troves, little fragments, little bits of Bible here and there. None of that has been as significant as what has been pulled out of the caves around Kumran, but the Kumran collection refers to those dead sea scrolls from Kumran. The dead sea scrolls in general refers to any piece or fragment of text from the ancient world that's found anywhere up and down that whole very long western shore of the Dead Sea. So these are dead sea scrolls, but not Kumran scrolls. Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. So when you think of quote, the Dead Sea Scrolls, like the Dead Sea Scrolls, traditionally that's what Christians are referring to as like, this is the reach back in time earliest texts that we have from what I would call the Bible and or Old Testament. And that's a really big deal for Christians and Jews. But you're saying the Dead Sea Scrolls as people of my faith think of, that's not like all the Dead Sea Scrolls. So there's like a big T, V and like a little T, V in terms of what we would hear here in the west in our news cycle, right? Yeah. So these are not from Kumran. These date to a later stashing that happened about a hundred years after the execution of Jesus. So you remember the big important historical event that happened in 70 AD, right? You've heard that date? Masada? Yeah. Okay. Masada is the end. It's the last holdout in a conflict between the Jewish people and the Romans. And of course, at Masada, which is along the coast of the Dead Sea, it's quite a ways down south from Kumran. You famously have the legend from Josephus about the last holdouts committing ritual suicide as the Romans are banging down the door. But the big thing that we associate with 70 AD is the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The Romans putting down the revolt once and for all. The zealous Jews had risen up to throw off their Roman oppressors and they got some good traction, but they lost. So this set of Dead Sea Scrolls dates to another 60 years after that and another similar rebellion called the Barcocca revolt, which had some messianic overtones. So the Jewish people at that time, they were looking for the savior, this character predicted in what you and I would call the Old Testament. The character of Christians say is Jesus, but the many Jewish people thought, no, it's this Barcocca guy. And so they followed him into armed rebellion against the Romans and it didn't work out very well and it ended badly. And so the thinking here is that this cave of horror or cave of horrors was a holdout where they found some bodies of people who didn't have anywhere else to go hiding out in these caves from the Romans and they just, they ran out of resources and they died. And somehow there ended up being these little fragments of religious text in there from a couple of Old Testament books and another discovery that I thought it might be more fun to bring in a buddy of mine to have him kind of explain the significance of it because I think this other discovery is the real gold mine here that will send your mind to new places. Okay, so you're saying a buddy of yours, but this is the guy that you've giggled like a school girl when you've been talking to me about him. This is the equivalent of the, this is Gandalf. We're about to talk to Gandalf. He would hate that. I mean, this guy's ludicrously humble. He doesn't think he's Gandalf. He thinks he's some dude. What's his name? It's name's John Monson. Is it like Dr. John Monson or? Very much so. Yeah, his PhDs from Harvard. So he went somewhere good. And dude's talented. He was raised in Jerusalem. But he's the son of Western parents. So he's, he's like all American sounds like you and me, but he's also like all Jerusalem might. And so he grew up on all of these legendary digs and archeological sites that people like me read about and hear these heroic stories of finding this thing or that thing. And it seems like every time I bring up anything when I'm talking with him, it's from that era. He's like, Oh, I know the guy who was there. Oh, I was right there when that came out of the ground. It's just fascinating frontline stuff. So I was talking with him the other day about these discoveries and he had some pretty cool insights and I thought it'd be fun to introduce the two of you. So you game? Yeah, but I feel, I feel like, okay, this is how it was what I feel like. Okay, I just got done rereading the Hobbit, right? Okay. And you know, when Bill Bose just hanging out and all of a sudden Gandalf shows up and it's like, Oh, I've heard of Gandalf, you know, like, I kind of am joking about the Gandalf thing, but I do feel like I'm in the presence of a great wizard or I'm about to be introduced to someone that I should, well, has this ever happened to you? They say, Hey, you're about to meet this person. And the way you address them is this, you know, like, Hey, you need to, you need to say Mr. President or general, whatever the name is, you know, like they tell you how to, you know, always say sir when they say something. I feel like we're going to be in the presence of someone like that. So I feel like you need to tell me how to talk to Dr. Monson. I think you're supposed to just call him John. Dude's so down to earth and easy to talk to. Yes, he is a wizard who knows many things and knows many people, but he doesn't wear that around like a t-shirt or something to let everybody know. But his particular areas of expertise are like archeology and history. Like, what's the same? Like languages, Old Testament, the historical research around the Old Testament, stuff like that. Semitic languages. Like, yeah. So like he knows these old languages. Well, let's ask him how many. I mean, he obviously has Hebrew on lockdown. Okay. I don't know which others. They teach a few ancient Near Eastern languages at the seminary I went to. He's a professor at the seminary I went to. Okay. And I don't know which ones of those he teaches. So we can just ask. Okay. I recently learned about a people group called the Ammonites. And I'm just going to like, I'm going to just lobby a softball and say like, by the way, who are the Ammonites? And then I'm just going to see how far he hits it. And then like you just rainy men when we need to do that. Does that work? Okay. That sounds good. Yeah. I'll let you do a bunch of the question asking because I'm excited to put the two of you in a room. Is that kind of the deal here? Like, is this kind of like when Dr. Casabri explained nuclear propulsion to you and then he helps you get an understanding of it? Is that kind of what you're doing to me right now? Yeah, maybe kind of. Okay. He did a masterful job of helping me get an understanding of that. What a ludicrously complex topic. Okay. There's some hack who doesn't have like one class in physics and undergrad and he made it make sense to me. So yeah, I think I think Dr. Monson is that kind of guy. Yeah. The difference is I have no history classes from university and my belt just books I've read. Yeah, but we hang out. I'm excited. Let's do it. Okay. Game on. Okay. Destin Sandlin. This is Dr. John Monson. Everybody Destin makes internet videos about science and things like that likes learning in general. John Monson is a professor of Old Testament languages and Old Testament in general at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School where I went for seminary and now I get to introduce you. So Destin John, John Destin. Pleasure to meet you, Dr. Monson. Yes. Awesome. Great to meet you, Destin. So wonderful to be here with you guys. It's my understanding and please correct me if I'm wrong. It's my understanding that you have researched like literally in the dirt a lot of the stuff that's coming out of the ground over in the Dead Sea area and you are somewhat of a wizard when it comes to archeology and history and things of that nature. Is that fair? Is it okay if I kind of think of you in that way? Probably overstated because I'm neither a wizard nor that accomplished but I've probably spent about 16, 17 years of summers in the field in various regions of the country. There are people who have done a lot more and know a lot more than myself but a lot of times people don't integrate that much and they tend to sort of focus on one thing. So maybe an upside end downside is that I tend to do lots of different things bringing together texts and artifacts and things like that. So let me just kind of understand where you come from, so to speak. So I hastily Googled your name when Matt told me your name and told me he was going to get you on the phone and all that. I hastily Googled your name and I'm assuming you are not Dr. John Monson that does rectal surgery in Orlando, Florida. That's correct, right? Absolutely right. Though I probably would be a much more successful career had I done that. Well, please forgive me. Did you seriously find a rectal surgery? I did. You said we're going to get this guy on the horn and I was like, I need to look smart. I need to Google quickly and I was like, whoa, this guy does rectal weight. And so, you know, the only thing I can say about the third entry down. I got to tell you about that. You know, they like to say the archaeologist career is in the ruins and I'll say at least my career isn't isn't somewhere else, right? That's fantastic. Please please forgive me for doing that. I can't help but notice that this Dr. John Monson that does rectal surgeries, he has five Google reviews, but like a 4.2 rating. So I got to think four of those surgeries went awesome. I would just it's really hard for me not to click on this to find out what that one negative review says. I just have to know. Oh, I won't. I'll resist the temptation. Yeah, it's hilarious that, you know, there was we lived out in Seattle for a season and there was a vice president there named Monson John Monson and we looked fairly similar. He would get my phone calls and I would get his and I, you know, ask him a couple of my friends at Microsoft, could I just change offices and salaries with you? It'd be pretty nice. That'd be pretty awesome. I was a grad student at the same. Yeah. Well, Dr. Monson, the question I have is my friend Matt here has done his level best to explain all types of archaeological finds and the importance of the dead sea scrolls to me and I know very little, I know about Qumran and the settlement there and the types of things that happened in that area that they were a very specific sect of Judaism. But it's my understanding that there was a significant discovery and you're the person to tell us about this because my understanding is you speak several languages. How many languages do you speak? Well, it depends if they're you talk fluency or not, but you know, in Jerusalem where I grew up, it's no big deal literally for people to know five languages. So I'm an underachiever in that count. And so I, you know, I ancient languages, I know a whole bunch of modern languages, just three or four. But yeah, in Jerusalem, it's just three or four, Dustin, just three or four. That's amazing. Just necessity over there in the Middle East. So I'm assuming English Hebrew Arabic. Is that true? Yes. My wife is German. So I, but I picked up German before I met her. So that was good at impress the in-laws when they, you know, when I asked if I could marry her. And so I listened to a lot of bakantatas and things like that. And you know, we have to do a lot of research in German too. French came and went, but then the ancient languages are all kinds of them. So I was reading in first Samuel the other day and I was reading about the Ammonites. And my understanding is there in the Jordan area. Is that true? Yes, we've got, you know, what's really interesting is in our world today, we tend to think of like, yeah, I'm going to move to Texas. I'm going to move to Houston or, you know, to Seattle. In the ancient world, of course, you know, you live off the land and the land is like multiple offspring. I mean, it gives you everything that you need. So these people groups that we read in various ancient texts are rooted in certain areas. And what's fascinating is to this day, they preserve some of that character. So the Phoenicians are out on the coast and, you know, the Philistines are down in the southern coast and then the Ammonites have their little territory around the region of, you guessed it, Ammon Jordan, Ammon Jordan. And the Ammonites are right across the Jordan Valley. You got to go down about, let's see, 2500 feet above sea level down to 1200 below. So 3600 feet. I used to do that on my bike. It was a lot of fun, but I burned out the brake pads often. But then you've got to go up the other way from 1200 below sea level up to Ammon, which is more like, you know, 3200 feet above sea level. And that's the region of Ammon goes up from the Jordan Valley opposite the scrolls and finds we're talking about. This is amazing. The oldest closure before we got on the phone, Destin was like, I just read about the Ammonites. I'm going to ask him. So I think that was his attempt to make sure I was telling the truth that you studied these things. And does that sound legitimate Destin? Or was that what you were hoping for? Well, here's what's interesting. So, you know, I think about this people group that I read about in historical context, and you think about a bike ride that you had. So if you grew up in this land and you know, like you can visualize these places, can't you? Yeah, they're all, I mean, literally, you know, growing up in the school I grew up in in Jerusalem, we had to sing, you know, certain, there are certain songs we sang and we had to adjust them for the locality around us. So like, you know, you talk about the Ammonites, my memory of the Ammonite region is, you know, multiple trips and events there and teaching there. But then renting a car once and beaching it on a really 4 by 4 only road going down to the Dead Sea in that steep drop, somehow carrying the car a small distance with some friends and then being on a straightaway in the Dead Sea and cruising and hitting a barbed wire barrier and having Jordanian soldiers come out and almost shoot me and have to tell them, hey, hey, I speak your language, you know, I'm not a spy, please let me go. Did it work? It worked. And I, you know, the car, I told them to take special look at the car and they just, they said no problem, looks great. And I was like, well, okay, from your, I'll take your word for it. That's amazing. When you were doing all these kids shenanigans, what are some of the really cool things that you got to see that if I went to that neck of the woods these days, I would not be able to just walk up and see? Well, you know, we all have our unique background. So I just counted a privilege to have grown up both in the time I grew up and the place because it was, you know, we arrived there not after the, not long after the 67 war. So the whole region was open and much less, you know, in a sense divided than it is today. So yeah, I mean, most of the major excavations of the time, my dad was a professor over there at American school. So I got to, I got to see up close most of these excavations more from human interest than even, you know, that even thinking I'd ever do anything with it. And then culturally it's a kaleidoscope. It's like you take Greenwich Village and, you know, all of Manhattan and New York City and put it into a tiny space of Israel, West Bank, Palestinians, every people group, every religion. It's just a massive kaleidoscope. So one of the most exciting things probably was, as a kid, I got called up by someone who was like an uncle to me, Gabrielle Barcay, the expert on Jerusalem. And he had discovered this tomb that was literally adjacent to our church in Jerusalem, the famous Cataphanom silver scrolls. So I left my summer job for a few weeks and helped them out and there were found the two silver amulets which actually predate up until that point what were the earliest biblical manuscripts that ever existed. These things are from the time of Jeremiah. So they're 600 BCs. There's 600 years earlier, you know, four to 600 years earlier than even the Dead Sea Scrolls we're talking about today. So those silver amulets are very, very famous and it was all downhill after that in archaeology. What can I tell you? Wait a minute. So what were the significance of these scrolls? What was on them? It was a blessing from the Bible? Yeah, these have a text from Numbers from the Hebrew Bible. May the Lord bless you and keep you, cause his face to shine upon you. And they had some sections of Deuteronomy. Now these were as big as the last part of your, the last knuckle up of your pinky finger when unrolled, if you can imagine that. It's tiny little things. They're in the Israel Museum today and on these tiny little silver amulets, little things they would wear as a good luck charm around their neck in biblical times. These things had 19, 15 to 19 lines of Hebrew text that stylistically fit perfectly the time of Jeremiah the prophet, which again is coming from a text that most people think is much later, but actually it's written down and circulated in the days of Jeremiah. And it mentions Jerusalem. It mentions, not Jerusalem, it mentions Yahweh on it, the God of Israel. Okay. So I don't know what an amulet is. Please forgive me. What is an amulet? It's just a small little text rolled up, or it can be actually a figurine of some sort too, but it's some sort of item that is worn as a form, almost of jewelry really. And it can be also something just, you know, hidden away for safekeeping, but it's kind of like just wearing a good luck charm. So it was a little tiny silver scroll rolled up and then with a string through it that someone wore around their neck before they were buried in this tomb that had people in it about, I don't know, several hundred people in it from way before the days of Jeremiah till way after it was a family tomb in antiquity in Jerusalem. So when did this happen? When were these found? These were found late 70s when I had long hair and more hair than I have now, sorry to say, late 70s, what, 78 I think it was, 79, something like that. Were you there? Did you get to see those come out of the ground? Well they were found in the sifting, yeah, I, well there were a small number of us there in the tomb, you know, extracting both bones and hundreds of intact pottery vessels, which in archaeology don't get that often perfumed flask. I mean, we were entering into a tomb that had not been opened for, oh boy, let's say at least 24, 25, 2400 years. So yeah, we were the first to see it, the lamp still had soot on them from where they were burning to light up the place when literally as they say in ancient texts, they gathered them to their mothers and fathers. They'd throw them in this sort of small cave next to a more open cave where there would be slabs of rock where they would lay the body and then the next person dies and they throw the previous person's bones literally into this, they call it a repository, a small little chamber and that's what we were digging. That's amazing. So were you sorting that out? Were you able to reestablish which bones belong to which person? Oh, this was, yeah, this was wild because even for the dry Middle East, there was some waste you're in there. So you can imagine as a 16 year old, 15, 16 year old, you know, whisking away on a skeleton and then getting to the skull and just the brush just was a little too much for it. This skull just implodes into fragments. So maybe, I don't know, maybe here's a question for the scientist here. How do you think we counted, how not we, but the, I mean, I was a kid, but how do you think the archeologists determined how many people were buried in that cave? I would say femurs. That's what I would do. You'd think femurs, but these are like 2,500 years ago. So there's something much more long lasting. Teeth maybe? Teeth or? Teeth, that's it. Teeth, you do statistical analysis of how many teeth the average, you know, whatever person had from other excavations and finds all over the place and other kinds of studies. And then you divide that number and find out, you know, there's several hundred people buried in there. That's amazing. That's crazy. And so you were, is this the only time you were actually in a dig like this or did you like fall in love with it at this point in time and decide this is what you were going to do your entire life or how did this go down? Well, it was very, very cool. And, you know, the archeologist, Gabriel Barca\u00ed, just a genius, you know, was already, you know, a colleague of my father's and such a, such a wonderful man. And it was just, just an accident of history to be invited to do that. I mean, there are people who live to dig basically. I stopped much of the digging experience when my kids were in that, you know, young age. So I've been on a handful of digs. There's some people who spend, you know, their whole lives based in excavations in the Middle East and around, around the place. So we all can speak the same language, so to speak, about artifacts and finds. But there are other, other decent discoveries I was participating in over, over the years. But of course, there are some really, really big time famous archeologists as well who have, you know, found much more than I'll ever find. But you got to say, I mean, the, the silver amulets are pretty big find in the, in the, in this Near Eastern world. It was a woman named Judith Hadley, a student of my father who taught at Villanova for many years later. She's the one who found them nearby after we had extracted things in the sifting. And brilliantly, she identified them from, separated them from clumps of dirt that otherwise would have been thrown out. So is it different when you find a little artifact that you were there for the discovery of what you call like a Canaanite shrine, a little bull and a shrine? Is it different when you find something like that in terms of just the way it feels the mood of the room versus when you find a tomb where there are bodies? Or is it just also old that whatever? Well, you know, you, you always want to show reverence, obviously, for the bodies. And there are specialists who come in and look at them and, you know, analyze them later. But, you know, I mean, archeology, nobody wants to admit it, but there is a treasure hunt element to it even to this day, even for responsible archeologists and finding texts is really the Holy Grail better than the cup at the end of the third Indiana Jones movie is finding a text and an archaeological excavation, which is why this, you know, recent thing is also so sensational. There is a certain maybe reverence, but, you know, you're always playful on the excavation, of course. But I mean, something like that silver, the silver calf, sorry, from Ashkelon, again, you know, it's, it's contribution, not that great because we had quite a few things like that in archeology already, but it's location at the entrance to the city in a small vessel that was mimicking a temple. And then the fact that, of course, you know, New York Times correspondent was there that day. I mean, that, you know, that all converges to really it was global excitement over that find in the early 90s. Well, what do you, the silver scrolls or the silver amulet that you're talking about? Well, if I were to Google that to try to see what it looks like or what it is, what would I type into the search bar there? You know, all you have to type is silver scroll Jerusalem and you'll find tons of pictures of it. And the best one probably is for perspective wise, you could type amulets if you want to use that word, but scrolls will do it and you'll get tons and tons of pictures of that. And if you get a couple of it in the museum, you'll see just how tiny it is to. OK, is it the silver scrolls of what's the word here starts with the K Ketef Ketef? Ketef Hinnom. Yes. And there's, you know, so many fun things. Exactly. There's so many things that intersect in the ancient world. So for example, you know, Ketef Hinnom is a phrase, the shoulder of the Hinnom and the Hinnom Valley is literally the valley that defined Jerusalem on its west side. Jerusalem is actually off the highway slightly and you had to go around to get to the most the earliest part of Jerusalem back in antiquity. And so this was the shoulder of Hinnom and it's actually mentioned in some border descriptions in the Hebrew Bible of the border between Benjamin and Judah in the south. So literally the valley was the border. The Ketef Hinnom was the periphery of the city in the days of Isaiah and afterwards. And then it was also a border description. But what's fun about that is Hinnom, Ghe Hinnom. OK, so Ketef means shoulder and Hinnom is the name. So if you go Ge Hinnom, Ge Hinnom, Guy is Valley or Canyon. So literally Gehena is the Canyon of Hinnom, Gehena. So it's interesting that our church in a church picnic in a given day, St. Andrew's Scott's Memorial Church, there would be a lot of guests there and they'd say, now in a Scottish accent, you know, the now the guests are welcome to join the congregation as we descend to hell for the monthly church picnic. And so so Gehena in the New Testament is a reference to this area that was the ongoing fire dumpster pit on the villages of Jerusalem. Am I remembering this correctly? That's exactly right. And right there, it's not to go to a two-delegate area, but in later times, that was still enclosed in the city in the New Testament period. I mean, the valley was the border and the Essenes themselves would run outside of the city through the Essene gate to relieve themselves because God forbid they would desecrate the Holy City in that way. Kind of fun. Oh, wow. And in the days of Jeremiah down below, they also, we read in the biblical record at least that they would sacrifice their children to Molot down there. And traditionally, that's where Judas hung himself and all kinds of other things. But you know, traditions have a way of layering just like the layers in ancient mounds in the Near East.

Strongly agree. I feel like poor Dr. John Monson is probably somewhere in Illinois rocking back and forth wondering what we're doing. We should go back to him. We should go back to the polite thing to do. We told him we were going to get things out of a cave. Let's go. That's amazing. I sit in here looking at this thing that you found and I'm understanding that this is literally one of the most important finds ever. The reason it's important is because it's getting back closer to the source. It's going way, way, way back. How was it dated to almost 600 BC? How did they date the scrolls? There are a couple of things. First of all, I remember it was Gabrielle Barcay, the famous archaeologist who technically found it. I was retrieving the dirt and digging up bones. I found lots of the gold earrings that are in the jewelry that's in the Israel Museum today. It's fun to go through the exhibits and say, yeah, I found that. It's kind of fun. Just like you have styles of soft drink hands or automobiles, the letters, of course, change over time. This is a pretty exacting science. The shape of these letters, that's one thing. The topography, it's called, or the study of ancient writing, pretty much you can nail it. We've been trained in this. Many people have been trained in this. The other thing is you always look for context. You look for finds that are similar. For example, if you're digging a house that has a destruction layer, like a bunch of ash, again, there are people who can speak to this much more technically than I can, but I've been there and done it too. Let's say you find a silver, not a silver, but let's say a scarab, something from an Egyptian pharaoh that says the date of the pharaoh. Well you know something about the date approximately, even though it could have moved up or down in excavation, that's another area of context you could begin to determine. From the pottery in this tomb, it was pretty clear that there was a fairly narrow range for archeologically speaking, it is a matter of a few centuries. It's a fun story because later on in my PhD program, it's kind of a sad story, this amulet, this inscription had not been published yet by Gabrielle Barcai, but he gave me two copies of very, very fine pictures of it. With his permission, I wrote one of my first grad school papers in my PhD program on this inscription and analyzing the date and everything else. And I came up agreeing with my teacher Gabrielle Barcai, the excavator, but not agreeing with Frank Moore Cross of Harvard University, who literally was the dean of all things ancient languages in the Near East at the time. And it was a really big talk about being between a rock and a hard place. It all worked out. I'm sitting here looking on the Wikipedia page and the Hebrew on the far right that's been trans, I don't know even if the word is translated or transposed into modern characters of Hebrew. Yes. And what's on the far left, which is the actual silver scroll, they look nothing alike, like nothing alike. Yes. Yeah, good observation. So on the left, it looks like some kind of alien language that a video game maker would make in order to like, oh, this is an alien language, we should make it look weird. But you're telling me that you have enough expertise to look at that silver scroll on the left. And you can tell that those are intentionally made scribbles and they mean something because you know that language. Well, yes, but I mean, it sounds more impressive than it is because there are only 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet. So you know, you can learn those pretty quickly. And let's just take an example. Are you looking at the one that's got a big gap in the bottom near the bottom of it? Yes, the bear caught. Kohanim 22. Yeah. Okay. So it's and it's got a big piece missing in the bottom, right? It does. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Because there are two of them. So if you go to the left, the silver, let's go to the middle one and you start at the top line and you go one, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. And if you get down to six there, the sixth line, you'll see on the right side, of course, believing Jews would not pronounce the name Yahweh. They would pronounce it Adonai, which means Lord because the name is too sacred to pronounce. But if you look over immediately opposite that, you'll see already two letters that are very similar with the zigzag letter in the middle. And the partially missing letter on the far right of it is the yod. So you've got yodhave of hay. So you've got YHWH there. And through there is Yahweh. So what happened is you can see the middle letter looks very similar, just a shaft standing up. The other one, the letters over time, they turned and twisted and people wrote them and made them more efficient. So on the right side is what eventually would be known as the square script. And then it's the modern script, literally on the right side of that diagram. Wow. That's amazing. There are again people who give their lives just to epigraphy. So that's where one has to decide. I've gone to distance in some of these things and taken as many classes and studied as much as you can. But there's some people dedicate their lives to the Dead Sea Scrolls or their lives to this or that aspect of field archaeology. So we're in the age of massive specialization just to be clear. There are others who can comment on this more than I can. I like the way you're pulling back that curtain on it because this is the kind of thing that when you're a kid, you come across these stories and you hear about archaeologists and for me at least, and I don't know if this is your experience, Destin, but for me, this stuff captured my imagination. The idea of going and digging a hole in the ground and there being something that would tell us about the people who were here before us. I mean, that's what I told everybody I wanted to be when I grew up. I would be an archaeologist and I didn't really understand what that meant at all. And then you get to be an adult and you start learning that even the most amazing discoveries look really pretty modest. I mean, that scroll doesn't look that awesome. And if I found that, it's a pity, but I'm an idiot. I would have been like, I don't know what that is. It looks like some child's chicken scratches. I wouldn't have even been nuanced enough to understand the value of the thing. But you took one glance at it and reading right to left, that name Yahweh just pops to you there on line six to you. It's elementary and to me as somebody who's even interested in this stuff, I just wouldn't even know what to look for. But you're telling me that not only do you see the name Yahweh, but just the way the scribbles are made, that tells you that this scroll is pre-nebiconeser, pre-Babylonian conquest. So therefore, 587 or earlier, just from the style. Is that correct? Yes, it's right at the cusp of the Babylonian invasion. And that was the debate in the paper I told you about, slightly before, slightly after. So you get all kinds of parallel texts and you literally say the tick on the vahve is slightly to the right of the tick on the vahve from the 50 year later inscription of blah, blah, blah. You go around like that. And just to be clear, I mean, this, I was much younger at the time and it was the brilliance of the student Judith Hadley who identified these things, separated them from clods of dirt. And then there was a whole debate of how do you unravel them because they weren't unraveled like this originally. They were rolled up. Kind of like you see bales of hay, certain kind of bailing of hay when it's all rolled up or a jelly roll or something. So they were literally rolled up and they had to be unraveled delicately without destroying them. So that was a whole other area of science. So at the beginning, it was very exciting that eventually they knew these were these were these so-called amulets, but it took time to unravel them and actually know it was on them and then came to sensation. So it was, I mean, the dig itself was a sensation, but it was some time later that the biggest sensation came out of it. So it's pretty amazing. But it's very simple. You just, each of our disciplines, we're all in different disciplines and you go around the block enough times and you learn the cracks in the sidewalk and you learn the somebody trimmed their tree or planted a new flower bed and you come to learn more and more as you go around the block more times. And that's true of aerospace. It's true of being in almost any discipline. So my son can tell me, well, he's a sophomore, but he can say, oh, dad, this is not the right terminology for this jet engine. I'm like, I have no idea what you're talking about. Wow. Okay. So that's, I mean, that's the excellent way of saying that because like in aerodynamics, you've got hypersonics and then you have, I mean, all these different things you can study, but what I'm realizing is in archeology, you have all these different languages. And what you're telling me is that to find text is, you know, the holy grail, it's even better than the holy grail. And so what I'm learning is that you have an expertise in a certain language. So like finding ancient texts is awesome, but having the expertise in an individual language, it's got like a timeline associated with it. It's not like knowing languages today where, oh, yeah, you're fluent in four or five languages. That's impressive to me. I'm not downplaying that. It literally is impressive to me. But it's like an arrow that goes backwards. It's like in geometry where you learned about a ray, you have a dot and an arrow pointing backwards. And you can take any language and you can go backwards. And then there's a whole history just of that language and you're going to be an expert in that. And that's amazing. I had no idea. It makes sense. I mean, it's kind of obvious now that you explain it to me, but I didn't know that. So a question I have about this is how many languages do you know? How many ancient languages do you know? And to what degree do you have that arrow pointing backwards in each of those languages? Like you would say, this is my expert language and I can tell you anything about it. And this one's something I dabble in. Is that a fair question? Sure. And you know, there are people trained in very narrow disciplines who may be the experts in this certain century of pottery, but they don't know much about the history or texts of that period. But yet you go to them when you find a certain form, an obscure form and they can tell you, oh, this is second quarter of the 13th century. And you know, the rest of us, well, maybe we can narrow that pottery to the century, but they would know exactly the fine nuance. It's a very same thing with writing, but sadly, a lot of archaeologists and even biblical scholars don't go down the path of learning these things. Now again, there are people who know a whole lot more than I do. My teacher, again, Frank Cross, Frank Moore Cross, we were at an excavation in Ashgolan and he came in for a visit and we were digging a period of time. And it was the Babylonian destruction of Ashgolan and Larry Stager, my teacher, was the excavator. And it was a horizon of ash and debris. And there was a number of inscriptions found, one of them found. Professor Cross was visiting and did not know from what area this inscription had come. And we asked him, so what, you know, how would you date this? And he says, well, he walked through his analysis and he said, yeah, where would you all put it? And he asked us and then he said, well, I probably put this the last 25 years of the yeah, the last 25 years leading up to 600 BC. And we're like, boom, nailed that 604 horizon of the destruction of the Babylonians that they wreaked upon Ashgolan. So the pottery and the small finds, jewelry, stuff like that, and the epigraphy or the ancient writing just matched aligned perfectly. And he had no idea what we were bringing to him. So for me, you know, I can do that in a number of the languages, but remember, they're all related one to another in certainly in the Levant or, you know, the Eastern Mediterranean. So, you know, what number you what when you say a number of the languages, like, give me an idea of how many ancient languages would you say you know? Well, again, it depends, you know, if you if you think of it as the mother languages, what we posit to be proto Semitic, you know, the original West Semitic language that is again is related to Arabic on the, you know, further to the East. There are the regional groupings of people who essentially wrote in the same kind of language, but they twisted it a little bit for their own purposes, vocab wise, maybe stylistically. So you have, you know, Arameans, Aramaic, Phoenician, of course, Hebrew, but actually there's Northern and Southern Hebrew, even in the biblical periods in the Israelite periods. And then you've got, um, Shibley across. Yeah, you've got exactly right. Shibley, exactly. You've got Moabite, you've got Ammonite, as you were suggesting, there are a couple chicken scratches down from Eden that nobody knows what to do with. And then there's of course some, some Philistine texts that nobody knows what to do with those either. But then there's, you know, hieroglyphics. And I'm way out of way out of my league on that. I just had a few classes. But then the big Eastern, Eastern language stuff is Acadian and various strands of Syrian Babylonian. They're same language, but different iterations of it. And then you go to the riddick north of Lebanon, the northern part of Syria is another language. But again, you know, there are a number of us who can do this. I'm not like some sort of outlier people who've been through integrative programs of ancient Near Eastern studies of the Levant and can do this as well, even despite their specialization, maybe in some other areas. Yeah. That's amazing. So when you use the term Semitic, that's like the mothership and all these other things are dangling off of that kind of like kingdom, phylum, you know, the organization of animals, Semitic is the mother kingdom, so to speak, of the languages. Is that how I understand that? Exactly right. Exactly right. So even, you know, if you even just Google family tree Semitic, S E M I T I C, you'll find like multiple charts of this. So we don't know what the proto Semitic was, the mother language exactly, although in, you know, the romance languages, we've got Latin, so we can, you know, work our way back from various languages, you know, French and whatever English and this and that Spanish. But the West Semitic, you could even see you could work your way down, you get to central West Semitic and then you get down to, to, you know, eventually to Hebrew. And of course, what's fun is modern day Hebrew is a resurrection of ancient Hebrew, which is really, really cool. And I have students who are from Syria, who their native languages are a matic. I mean, these languages are living today, just like I said at the outset, the geographical cultural realities have a certain continuity to them as well. This is amazing. And Aramaic is fun because it's the, it's the third and oft forgotten language that the Bible was written in originally everybody knows Greek and Hebrew, but there's a little dash of Aramaic in the Old Testament, little dash of Aramaic in the New Testament. And so if I'm hearing you right, people still speak this language in roughly the same form that it was, you know, the parts of the Bible were written in that Jesus spoke. Exactly. I mean, I was, you know, watching the passion of the Christ for the first time Mel Gibson and, you know, it's in Aramaic. And, you know, after a little while, I didn't really didn't really need the subtitles. And so they did a really good job. Yeah. What must that have been like? I mean, you're one of a handful of people on earth who got to appreciate that movie as though we're being spoken to you. I mean, that's crazy. I hadn't thought about that. It's quite fun. Well, the best part is when, you know, and again, there are many people, like I say, many people who know many languages, you know, I don't claim to be any anything special. So literally it's not false modesty. It just, I mean, I watch some of the videos that both of you do. And I'm like, man, I didn't know about that aspect of Greek Orthodox theology. You know, Matt, or I didn't know that, you know, if you, whatever, saw an eclipse in this way, both of you, that, you know, it would turn out like this. So, you know, we're all, you know, we do what we love or what, you know, we sense we should do and spend enough time in it and you get to get to know something about it. And it's kind of, it's kind of fun. What are these moments that are like unlock moments for you? I've heard the words Semitic my entire life. And I had no idea that it had anything to do with a language. That's a language term is what I'm understanding here. It's like, or Semitic languages. Is that true? I'm sitting here looking at this graph. You had me Google and it's amazing because when I'm reading in the Old Testament, the Kings and Samuel and all that, I'm seeing where they're going over to talk to the Philistines and they're ticking off the Ammonites. And I'm like, well, if these are Hebrew people and these are Ammonites, how are they talking? And then I'm looking here at this chart and I'm seeing that, oh, Hebrew, Moabite, Ammonite, and Edomite and Phoenician, all these are kind of similar in tongue. It's almost like Dutch and Afrikaans in South Africa. It seems like there was some, I don't know, like a dialect. Like Afrikaans, my understanding is very, very similar to Dutch. It's a very young language. And so, am I in the ballpark here? Like they could talk to each other because their language is so similar? You guys are such clear thinkers and absolutely right. And that's why, for example, Egyptian has some overlap with these, but not complete overlap. Or for example, if you see a cadian, East Semitic, a galu in a cadian is, you know, big house. And He-hao in Hebrew is... Hemple, right? So, big house and He-hao is palace or temple. So you can see I was really being not really being falsely modest when I said, you know, you look Aramaic, paleo-hebro-punic Phoenician, Moabite, Canaanite, Euguritic. It's a big handful to say or a cadian, Ablite, Assyrian, but pretty much all the languages in the chart. If you're really working in Semitic languages, this Eastern Mediterranean into the interior to the East, languages, pretty much you're going to encounter these and it's a matter of learning the twists and turns of the variations. And what's so fun about this, this is one reason I didn't sort of throw my whole life into language only or archeology only or let's say, you know, ancient history only, is that you see manifestations of peculiarities, the idiosyncrasies of these cultures. You find them not only in textual adaptations, but you find that in architectural adaptations. And you find them in pottery adaptations and jewelry adaptations and ideology adaptations. So, you know, the Euguritic literature has tons of material that talks about Baal riding the clouds and, you know, bringing down the cedars of Lebanon and everything. And then you open up your Hebrew Bible and you see, oh, well, there it is, you know, you always describe as doing the same thing, how interesting. Let's go over to the Moabites and see how they describe their deity, Kimosh, and their one inscription that we have from them, right? So you, you know, you find these things all fit together, but they manifest in different ways. So for me, language and cultural artifacts are two strands of expression that are rooted in an underlying geographical slash ethnic slash historical framework. And that's what makes it for me personally, just so exciting. This is incredible. Thank you, Matt, for introducing me to Dr. Monson here. I mean, like one. I'm grinning. But what is so interesting here is I'm sitting here thinking about like today, we're documenting our culture today in tweets and whatever. And like the amount of time from my Microsoft and carda CD-ROMs until the gigantic archive that is Wikipedia, the amount of time that that happened is like 20 years. And to understand, to find a CD in the future and try to decode the dots on the CD, and or the little perforations in the metal and try to turn that into something that makes sense. Like you have to have a very sophisticated understanding of a software build on how CD-ROMs work and all this kind of stuff. And to understand tweets, you know, Lord knows how we're going to archive that stuff for future generations. So you make me realize two things. You have the ability to decode the past in ways that other people don't. So your skill, and you modestly, you're saying that a lot of people have the skill, but this is like without the skills that you have, we lose everything backwards. We lose all of that. And so that makes me think like, what should we do now to make your job easier in the future for now? I don't know. This has taken my brain to some crazy places. And I thank you for that. Well, Ditto and Ditto for both of you, the many videos I've seen and my family has seen. And by the way, I spread the good news to lots of people about your videos, both of you, and their very educational one. Thank you very much. No, seriously. It's just great. And I have to say that the fundamentals of civilization are pretty basic. I mean, you've seen that chart, you know, the human needs. Like you've got food, shelter, right? You work your way up to significance. And I know it's a meme already, so to speak, but you know, underlying all that today is Wi-Fi, right? You know, it's more important than food or shelter, at least to my kids it is. But you know, the question becomes those fundamentals are still the same. I mean, we get an earthquake, we get a big storm, and we're back to where's the nearest water source? How am I going to eat next week? Who's going to try and hurt me? I mean, those things are all the same. And this almost in a way, veneer of electricity, which, you know, one, I'm not the scientist like you guys, but you know, one sunspot could potentially want EMP. And hey, we're back in the, we're back in the medieval period potentially. So, you know, what does this mean for the digital world? Well, first of all, the Dead Sea Scrolls have been, of course, out there digitally for a long time, which is wonderful. It's democratizing it in a certain way. But we know we need to be sure there's certain amount of certain number of hard copies and things as well. But the core issues of, you know, a doorway, a window, you know, a latrine. I mean, those things are going right through the ages, even though we've got this hyperbolic increase in knowledge and mobility. I'll just say that, you know, the late Bronze Age of Egypt, roughly a time of Joshua in the biblical period, that was pretty much a global age. And so was the Roman period. It was a global age. The house I grew up in in Jerusalem was built by an Armenian fellow in 1907. And pretty much it had a robust garden that you could live off of. It had a septic tank. And then it had a cistern that filled up with water from the roof. And then even the layout of the house was really not that simple, not that different from Arab houses of preceding centuries and right the way back to Roman houses and all the way back to Israel, right houses. It's pretty phenomenal how the fundamentals of civilization are pretty stable, even with the massive increase in knowledge and mobility. This is incredible. You mentioned when you were talking about the languages, you mentioned Ugaritic. And I remember that coming up, I remember some classmates taking a course here, they're in that language in seminary and I didn't take it. I don't really think about it. But it doesn't come up anywhere else. So is there some artifact or something that is in Ugaritic or Ugaritic, however you say it, and that's the reason seminary students get taught the language? Yeah. Well, remember we talked about texts being everything, right? So the reason this site, you've got is so significant. And again, there are people who dedicate their lives to the study of this one site. Well, not too many people, but there are some people. And you can just, you know, UGA, RIT, you can Google it and you'll see, you know, lectures and images and courses and all kinds of stuff come up. The thing about it is that remember, we talked about text being so significant. So there were found here, okay, number one, a very, very impressive level of preservation. So I mean, typically you get foundations of buildings, but not superstructure of buildings. If you go back, you know, before the Roman period, it's really a crapshoot of what you're going to find. So here you have literally the whole layout of a city preserved because of its quick destruction, perhaps by the sea peoples who came from my seany and everywhere else around, you know, 1200 BC or BCE as people would say. And this is in Syria? In Syria, yes, north, a little bit north of, you know, Beirut and Lebanon. Okay, so that's one thing. It's so well preserved. Secondly, they found, the French excavators found a massive number of text there on clay tablets. Now, one of the reasons why these would be preserved is because remember I said there are 22 letters and you were looking at that silver amulet? Well, what they did at Ugarit is they didn't use, to our knowledge at least, as much parchment and let's say ink writing on parchment and pieces of pottery as sort of letters and stuff. They reduced and selected a few cuneiform letters and those cuneiform letters, remember, that's the language of the Acadians and the Babylonians and the Assyrians. And those look like chicken scratches, like little chopsticks almost indifferent. It looks like almost like Chinese. And you know, my wife is doing organic chemistry, you know, we could exchange notes from my Acadian notes and her organic chemistry and say, hey, same thing. What's the difference? And so got to go order more benzene. Yeah, the accident of history is that the Ugarit world was writing in essentially another form, like you say, almost of Hebrew, mow by all those languages, but they were recording it with the 22 letters being represented by cuneiform, that is, chicken scratch letters, that they wrote on clay that were preserved even when the fire came and burned the city down. So, you know, all the papyrus was burned, but the clay remained and had the Israelites written on clay wedges, like, you know, the ancient Babylonians and everybody else. We have massive record outside of the Bible. So then when they studied this literature of Ugarit, they found that there was massive overlap between concepts, familial structures, architectural terms, massive overlap with what was in the Israelite world and the orbit of those semi peoples south of there. And so this was, that's why you guard it to such a massive thing, well preserved better than most places, and then text, text, text, fantastic. Well, buddy, Dustin, I really appreciate what you're saying about how we're looking into all of these tiny little avenues to go back and reestablish things that should be completely lost. And that's a fun of it is we can't put everything back together. We're never going to put everything back together. And every time we come across a kumran, Ugarit, this kind of stuff, it's like one more portion of our distant past is opened up to us and then we need people to come along and decode it. But also, every time we find something like this, the fun of it is that you take this giant leap backwards in history and things that should be getting further away through the natural progression of time. Instead, all of a sudden are getting closer to us in terms of understanding with each little swipping of the brush, with each little scoop of the shovel, we're just that much closer to understanding what was going on. And so I don't know much about Ugarit. I'm looking it up here as you're talking about it. But to me, what you brought up, John, when we were talking the other day about the new discovery that was the premise of this whole conversation we're having on the Dead Sea, the thing that stood out to me is that the actual text that we got there is a little chunk from Nehum, a little chunk from Zechariah. And that's interesting because it confirms the continuity of what you and I would call the Old Testament. And that's great. But you said there was something else that got found in there that for you was the real mind bender. Can you talk about the other discovery in this recent cave of horrors excavation and why it's such a big deal? Yeah, it's just so fun. And again, there are people dedicating much of their lives to both finding these things and then analyzing them. The manuscripts that were found, we already had in those caves copies of the so-called book of the 12, which is, or one might call them the minor prophets in the sort of Hebrew Bible tradition. And it's fascinating that it would be Zechariah and Nehum, which are texts that talk about justice and, you know, God's judgment. It's kind of interesting, you know, whatever one takes from that. But the finding a few more manuscripts, they are slightly different translation into the Greek from the other translations into the Greek that we have. So that's very interesting. But right in that same cave, and I've been up above that cave, it's several hundred feet down to repel down, which I have never done, but I've been hiking all over that area, just sort of digging down carefully like you do anywhere in excavation. They came across some woven kind of material and they kept going and they thought, what in the world, they kept going and going and then they did some analysis and found that here in this cave is a large basket preserved, not from yesterday's picnic, not from the Roman period and the late Roman period of these scrolls that were found, fragments, not from the halcholicic period, which is like 6,000 years ago, which they found a burial of a young boy with his garment still on him. Again, from 6,000 years ago, this thing, basket, preserved out there in the desert, is what, something like 10,000 years ago. And so, I mean, this is to me much more significant than a few more fragments, although again, our statement about text being the preeminent thing, yes, absolutely. But it's just astounding, this large basket that they carefully extracted was, let's just say when Joshua, whatever chronology you take and whatever religious view you have, let's say Joshua came about 1300, 1200 BC to the land of the Bible, according at least to the Hebrew Bible tradition. So that's 1300 BC. We are, what, several times closer to Joshua in time than that basket is to Joshua. It's just astounding, astounding to me. So let me understand, it's a basket? That's what was found? It was a basket, a woven basket, a basket woven with kinds of, you know, reads and straw and whatever else. And that basket looks a lot like the kinds of pottery we get later, but this basket was made before pottery was invented. And the revolution of going from hunter-gatherer to actually growing crops and settling in one place looks like it occurred after the time of this basket, if you can imagine that. I'm looking at it. It's very tightly woven. Yes. Like very tightly woven. Like this took a long time. It's in beautiful condition. It looks like you could use it. Exactly right. You could, it looks like feels like, I mean, it looks like you could use it today. But I mean, of course, we'd never do that. But the thing is that it literally, I mean, originally in the so-called Neolithic revolution, you know, when they started making pottery, they didn't have wheels to turn it quickly. And, you know, the technology to make a smooth, nicely rounded basket. So they sort of matted play together and turned it around on a flat mat. And some of the pottery that we have looks similar in both patterning and construction to what the basket has. So in a way, it's both a window into that development of human civilization. And also, what were these people doing storing, perhaps, such a huge amount of whatever it was, grain dates, who knows what was in that thing. They clearly were hiding something or getting, you know, getting away from somebody and nearby from haves and a site that are several thousand years after this basket. We have beautiful metallurgy from a temple at a place called Aangeti. So, you know, people were doing very intricate, beautiful things already in this very, very, very, you know, it's like almost the Flintstones of the old, you know, like you say, the old comic strip and the old, you know, cartoon. How do they, two questions. Number one, how do they know this predates pottery? Number two, how do they know this is 10,000 years old? Well, one thing would be, you know, again, context. And then we don't have any inscription here in this case. So you can't, there's, you know, no writing that we know of. Maybe there's some caveman drawing somewhere. I don't know. Maybe that'll be the next find in the cave. You know, that would be in sensation too. Lasko caves in the Judean wilderness. Who knows? But we do, I don't do. There are real experts in this too and whole conferences, they hold on these things, but the decay of carbon, you know, the carbon C14 and, you know, radiocarbon analyses can show you the decay of carbon material. That gives you certain clusters of dates that form almost like a little bell on a chart. And the stronger ones are the likely dates that this goes back to. So that would be the main way to do it in this case because, I mean, literally, unless you had some of those tools, I mean, in this case, what do we know about stylistics of baskets when there are no baskets like this that we can compare or really even much pottery? You don't have ground truth. That's right. Oh, that's cool. They can figure out the species of plant that it was made from, couldn't they? Oh, absolutely. They will, if they haven't done it, they will be doing it soon. And again, there are total experts over there, of course, doing this. And they also will be, they're really looking at the pretty much destroyed material inside this basket because they can analyze and find out. I mean, I found myself lots of olive pits and green and stuff like that going back to the biblical periods and before, but this is a quantum leap even further back. And so they'll have to find some ways to analyze what was in this basket. And that will tell us a lot about how these people lived so many years ago as well. I remember the first time I ever went to Paris. I went into a church that had been in some way commissioned by or blessed by or was built on the site of a church associated with Clovis, the sixth century Maravindian king right at the very beginning of Christianity in France. I remember walking in there and reading this little thing about it and it caught me off guard. I didn't know anything about this particular church. And obviously the church that was there was built over and built up and the original stone, there was just a little bit of it. But still, I just stood there and marveled at this connection. That was my first time in Europe. This connection to something 1500 years old that I'd read about and I'd studied. It just blew my mind. And then you think about what we're talking about here in a part of the world that I'm hyper interested in with stories. I have learned about my entire life in U2 Destin. And here you've got something that somebody just a few months ago pulled out of several layers deep in this cave that is so old that if Abraham himself had been there, and I mean, Abraham's associated with Hebron, Nal Hever, where this canyon where it was found is just a few clicks away from Hebron. So now let's imagine the patriarchs. Imagine somebody like Abraham there and let's put him at 2000 ish BC, which is maybe a little generous, but I'm asked 4000 years back for URI, which means that if I were to go into this cave and we found out that Abraham had been in there and he just left a note to a tablet or something and it's like, well, you know, dear journal, just another day traveling around trying to figure out what my new life is going to be about. If he'd left something like that in that cave, which is, of course, absolutely absurd. And then I went in that cave and I found that thing that would not be as old a discovery if Abraham, when he was chiseling that thing out, hypothetically in that cave, had dug into the dirt and found this basket, Abraham's hypothetical discovery of this basket, even 4000 years ago, would have been a further jump back in history than me finding something from Abraham. That's crazy. It just, it boggles the mind. I don't even know what to do with that kind of time range. That's insane. Yeah, it's astounding. And you know, they found the Weitzmann Institute is where they're, you know, analyzing this. That's like the sort of, I don't know what you'd say, Haltech, Salk Institute, MIT of Israel. And we have some friends there, but yeah, what's going on here? You're absolutely right. It shows the resilience of human ingenuity. And you know, you come to think of it, survival is one of the main things that any species tries to do. And clearly, there's some change going on here that they feel the need to make that much effort to get out there. Now think about it, that 3000 years after this basket is the Calcolithic period where literally they are going to the peripheral areas again. Maybe something bad has happened in the highlands. We don't know why, but they settlement seems to be in the peripheral areas in the desert and the immediate deserts. And they are bearing themselves in bone boxes and they are making beautiful sectors and crowns. And there's a temple at Iangeti for the Calcolithic period, you know, four or 5000 BC where there's still an altar there. I mean, it's been excavated. And you know, you walk in there, you think, what took place here all those years ago? What happened there? And then you start thinking in an interconnected way and biblical character David would have been in that same Iangeti region might have come across some of the ruins of this thing. And had David gone in and hidden in this cave, he would have found some of this stuff, not the Barcoque of the stuff, of course, but some of these earlier things, which again, blows the mind because it's in that immediate area that David was running away from Saul to save his life from this king that was out to get him. And then you think further forward, I mean, Christians came out in this area to sort of get away from it all and pen their hymns and their traditions and their make their icons. And in between all that, Jesus was tempted in the same wilderness. It's kind of a kind of extraordinary. All these traditions come together. So a quick question. I'm looking at a picture of the cave of horrors and I'm seeing these archaeologists and they're clipped in with climbing gear and you said they repelled down to this. So is that kind of the thing is that these caves were kind of in the side of a sharp cliff. And so you could go put things in it, kind of like putting stuff in a safety deposit box, because you know, it's very hard for other people to get to it. Absolutely right. But there may be two different, I mean, a couple of different things to think about there. If you Google not how ever you'll see some pictures of these cliffs, N-A-H-A-L space H-E-V-E-R, N-A-H-A-L space H-E-V-E-R. I mean, you look at in antiquity, I mean, who knows what happens. I mean, we read in the Psalms, the earth reeled and rocked. I mean, we don't know geologic time and we were getting into geologic time here with, you know, something that far back. I mean, maybe there was an easier access at that time. Who knows? But in the end of the day, certainly in the Roman period, this was a place to escape. And then the Calphalithic period, 6000 BC, they are actually burying somebody. They're using as a burial. So maybe they found shelter there, maybe to get away from an enemy or maybe who knows. And so that earlier period, imagine if we had found artifacts in their bodies or bones or, you know, I don't know, little mementos of things or who knows what we would have been thinking had we found it that way. But yeah, today you have to repel down several hundred feet. Oh, no, let's see. What is it? 60 meters, 80 meters? So yeah, that'd be over 200 feet. You'd have to repel down and just find it in the first place. Now, why were they doing it in the first place back in the day in the 50s? Because the Dead Sea Scrolls up at Qumran were found in caves. And so they realized, you know, in times of stress, the Jewish people of the, let's say, first, second century BC through to the first century 80, they were, they were, among other things, getting away from it all. And what do they take with them? Their most sacred possession, which was again, right back to manuscripts, you know, the icon and guide of their faith. The family Bible, the big thick one. That's right. The big one. That's a great way to put it. And if you look at those clues, by the way, just by the way, think of imagery from literature all over the world. But let's just zoom in for a moment on the biblical Psalms. I mean, you know, you make my feet like the feet of a deer, you know, you bring me up out of the heights, you set my foot upon a rock, a sure rock, a foundation, you brought me up out of the pit. I mean, every tradition has such imagery, but particularly the biblical imagery of the Psalms is very much alive in this immediate area, which would activate lots of their thinking too. All right. So often we talk about sponsors here on the show, but this is not a sponsor. This is something we just want you to know about because we love this person that's doing this. And she knew about Notre Dame questions before anybody did. And we really want to support her. And that is this project about Lulu the Beaver, which is a children's book created by Bethany. And it's awesome. Would you like to explain it to the third chair who Bethany is, Matt? Yes, I would. Bethany is our friend. We have multiple family friends that all overlap the Sandlands, the Whitman's, Bethany's family, some other folks. So we all know each other and we all hang out when we're in town and we stay in touch. And Bethany is somebody I met through art. She did the logo design and all of the art for Notre Dame questions for smarter every day, for 10 minute Bible hour for the new project I'm working on right now for the ThinkerCon event that you put together, Destin, she's a ludicrously talented lady and incredibly empathetic and soft hearted and kind. And particularly, she's she's wired exactly right to go start to finish in making a children's book. And that's what she's done. And this book that she's put together, it's beautiful. And it's not a favor to her for us to mention it on the program. It's a favor to you because we're putting you in touch with something that's legitimately awesome. Yeah, this is what's going down. Our friend made a beautiful, amazing book. And we want you to know about it. And she's doing a Kickstarter thing. She's trying to get it off the ground. And this is just amazing. It's beautiful. And we want you to know about it. So how do we throw to this, Matt? I don't know how to do this. So should we put a link just in the show notes? Is that the best way to do it? That's exactly how we do it. Yeah, rather than reading a URL, it'll just be right there toward the top of the show notes. You can follow that. And in whatever way it's possible to jump in and help make this thing go and get set up to get a copy, that'll all be evident right there through that link. Yeah, go get the book about Lulu the Beaver. Can we talk about the book? Is it a spoiler? A spoiler kids book? I mean, what do we do here? Yeah, you don't want to go too far into that because it's narrative. It's a story. Let's do this. What does it deal with in your mind thematically? Okay, so Lulu is a beaver. And beavers are supposed to be a certain way. But Lulu was industrious, industrious, engineer like, but Lulu wants to be a different way. And the story is about Lulu's journey to break out of that beaver shell. So to speak, I don't know how to explain it. It's really good. It worked for me. It's good. There are elements of that process that everybody goes through of feeling like, okay, there's stuff I need to do in life. That's true. There's stuff you need to do in life. But also, there's stuff that captures your imagination and that activates those parts of your heart that are unique to you and unique to how you see the world. And I think to some extent, everybody wrestles with the expectations that are placed on us in just being a part of a society, which is a good thing. It's good that there are some expectations. But we wrestle with those pressures and also the outside the box stuff. Well, what if we did it this way? Well, what if I did it that way? What if I made this thing? And I think everybody feels a little degree of insecurity when we start to venture outside the box. Yeah, the self-doubt. To our own creative ideas. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very honest walking through of that in a way that is designed to be helpful and fun for kids who are getting to that creative stage in life where they're learning to balance the inside the box and the outside the box stuff. And I just think it's wonderful. I love what it touches on. So the bottom line is, our friend made a beautiful book and we want it to be physically printed and we want you to have a copy. And she's doing a Kickstarter thing. And we really wanted to meet her goal so that she can get as many of these things printed as she feels as necessary. We would genuinely like it if you as a member of the third chair would consider clicking on that link in the show notes and go to the Kickstarter and support Bethany in this venture because we really want to see this thing just take off pun intended. And you'll see what that means when you read the book. And we think you'll appreciate it. We're not just asking for a solid because we really like our friend Bethany. We genuinely think this is an awesome book and that it will provide value to you and your family or another family that you know that has kids. Absolutely. So check out that link please. And as always because it's on the internet and I want it. My mom is going to sign up for whatever this thing is 50 times over but there's only so much one lady can do. So if there is an actual audience here, which I'm still not totally sure of, it'd be awesome if you went and supported this. But mom, if it's you and if it really just has been you all along, could you do a few more of those for Bethany because I really want the thing to work? Thank you. I love you. What I find really fun about this stuff is that it gets us one step removed from the belief part of my faith, which I think is rooted in reason and history and philosophy and it's also it's faith. So I love talking about that and I love thinking about that stuff on my YouTube channel and you know with other people who are up for it. But what's also really fun is that a topic like this lets you workshop the raw materials of a lot of these things that overlap with religious stuff with anybody who thinks anything. It's cool that you can I mean I'm not going to go physically touch that basket and wreck it with the oils on my hands but it's cool that that basket is something that I can tangibly touch and instead of even taking it on faith that there were people here at thousands and thousands of years ago. We assume that's true but hey there's something physical that people with bodies like mine and dealing with stressors like I deal with here's something that they made and here's something that people who are passionate about figuring out the big questions life, death, eternity, purpose, deity, creation, existence, all of that kind of stuff here are texts that they were reading back then that they felt were transcendent and pointed to something bigger and that I still read now and also believe are transcendent but that also somebody coming from a position of not belief can look at and really appreciate along with a person of faith this continuity of searching of understanding of trying to comprehend even the littlest thing about the divine and about human purpose and I think sometimes it can be intimidating for people who are coming from a not belief not religious perspective to get into the philosophical theological conversations because it's just I don't know it feels like you're just different dealing in a different world if you're not really into that stuff I don't know you're throwing your energy at something else and that's okay but here it's fun because we can we can look at something tangible and we can learn things about the past together and we can think about the assumptions of people who came before us and then even compare notes with how those assumptions might overlap with us today and so I just love talking with you John because you've spent so much time not just around the world of digging these things up and reconnecting us to the past and giving us the opportunities to have the kind of conversations I just talked about and that we just had but also you've actually done it not just learned about it and reported on it but yeah you've actually been there and you know what it's like to see something coming out of the ground and it's just energizing to hear the stories and to hear your understanding of it so it gets the point is thank you yeah as dumb as it sounds like I now know a person that knows that it's legit you know what you see in the news like oh this is this and I've always like okay well I'm sure there's some smart person out there that understands it and you're talking to me and you're telling me it's legit and I don't know why but because you're telling me in my language it matters yeah those are you know this it's such a delight to interact with with both of you and right back at you I mean I look at aspects of a nuclear sub or the cosmos whatever John we're talking about languages don't deflect but it's it's it's all it's all the same uh you know astounding if you have a grasp of the wonders of the you know what we see around us and the you know the flow of human history I've been down to Houston and you know taking my kids and we've been in the Mission Control Center and we've seen the Apollo 18 on its side you know the Saturn and but you know I know nothing about being near a launch like like you have destined and just experiencing the wonder of both physics and human achievement in those things so you know it's wonderful we can all share and grow and learn from each other and connect to our past but hey literally to our future as well I'm gonna do the thing where I overly put a bow on it but I'm doing it anyway I can't resist the temptation this conversation is what I love about our friendship Destin it seems like we are dealing with such different things but natural philosophy is science it's not just the forerunner to science it is science it's exploring the ones and zeros and observing the concrete world as well as the rational invisible world to try to get to a word you like a lot my friend truth and humans all men by nature desire to know we all want to know we all want to figure it out we run the math equation maybe a little bit differently we've got maybe a little different pressures or ambitions in this age or that age whenever we're on the stage of human history but when you bring on Dr. Casabri and he's explaining how nuclear propulsion works and what that might look like in the next ventures into deeper space I'm hearing about something that is connected and that doesn't happen unless whoever that guy was and that lady was that made a basket eight or ten thousand years ago made the basket the basket and the nuclear propulsion they're all part of the same story and I just think it's awesome that we get a little moment in the whole thing and I happen to believe there's something larger to that narrative as well but it's still cool that it's something that I can high-five someone who sees it differently than me in terms of the question of deity and be like hey that we are a part of something that looks like it's going somewhere and that has a beauty to the narrative yeah that's very powerful you know I'm going to say something that will probably cause you to just think I'm just total wacko but I have seen for example the Fibonacci sequence as we all know it's shells and you know sunflowers and the stock market I mean my kids and I made some good money in the stock market following the Fibonacci pattern of just crowd investing but I overlaid the Fibonacci sequence onto one of my four thousand year charts that my father has produced and wouldn't you know that some of the major upheavals in ancient history depending on how you sort of lay it out actually would seem roughly to align with some of the Fibonacci sequence so I know I sound like a total wacko but I've been kind of intrigued by that and I put the whole of this under a framework of what I call physical theology it's term I kind of invented physical theology and that doesn't mean theology like you know studying the Bible or Islam or Buddhism everybody's got their theology but even if you you know if you don't believe in a higher being you have some sort of worldview so maybe worldview is a better way to express it but a physical worldview of physical theology we we live out what our priorities are and what our needs are and we leave remnants of that for people to explore later on and you know part of looking to the future and exploration and the wonder of science is a kind of physical worldview physical theology because we we want to know more we want to know what's on the dark side of the moon we want to know if we can live on Mars we want to we want to know if some of those things we've we've seen in Star Trek you know actually are out there not just these cell phones today haha but you know the the wonders that lie beyond so yeah we bring together curiosity and our worldview into a physical framework and it just it's a gift that never never stops giving. Okay last move before we wrap it up Destin can you walk us through what the dead seaskerels are and where the cave of horrors fits? Yes with certainty I can nail it plus or minus you know to about 600 for 605 BC is that is that acceptable? That's one that sounds perfect I don't know what the you're sorry I just made it up okay you got you got kumaron kumaron you got you got these crazy people that went out there and they they kind of went to live out in their own little I'm not gonna say cult but their own little special enclave of Judaism out there and they're out there hanging out and it was very important them to document a bunch of stuff they had all these documents they put them in caves and then gradually we started finding them and because of the arid climate out there and the fact that they wrote all these on different types of things that wouldn't disintegrate in that particular climate would have been better if it was like cuneiform and they could have put it on clay tablets for us but they put it on papyrus and things like that but in this cave of horrors we have a completely different thing this is this is a cave that's in a different location and when we go in there there's a lot of burial type things is it my understanding that this was a place where they would put people John am I saying that correctly? Well they became poor as you know 130 AD the Jewish people were getting away from their enemies and they a bunch of people died in their probably of starvation so that's why it's named cave of horrors from 130 AD but then this other burial was from 6000 BC and then the basket way earlier but those people in 130 AD the Bar Cook where we vote they're the ones who left a couple of these fragments of biblical texts. Got it. Okay back to you, Dustin you're not up the hook yet. Okay cool so the thing that I really learned here which isn't is not about the specifics of this specific cave or specific archaeological finds I learned more broadly how archaeology as a discipline works specifically in this area you've got all these languages broad master grouping of languages which is the afro asiatic language tree I guess you could say and the Semitic languages are one little spur that comes off of that and depending on where you are in time you can kind of even from how people write letters you can figure out exactly where you are from context clues and so archaeologists not only have to be very aware of the language itself and the history of the language itself but they have other context clues that they can draw from like pottery and cultural things like even how they built the house or things of that nature as long as you understand the context of a specific culture you can start to understand when something happened and why people believe the certain things of that nature even what they do with their dead which makes me think crazy things like you know there was an iron age and then you know before that bronze age we're going to have a very specific line in our archaeology where plastic exists so there's going to be a very specific like oh here's where the plastic started with bakelite in the 1950s so this is one of the first polymers so we're at least to the late 60s or whatever it's helping me understand now better and how people in the future are going to look back and see us by how we look backwards and see people from antiquity that's the main thing that I've drawn from this so dang good so dang good excellent explanation of all of that I really appreciate the observation about the plastic age too I don't know john did that sound right to you you know that's so clearly stated and we were just working through my recently deceased father in law's house and you know there are old records going back to the thick old records from way back and then some of his books in the old German script which which even Germans today many most can't read and then he had CDs and cassette tapes as well and eventually he had an iPad so I mean he lived this this stretch of these different eras and my kids will always be pre-iPhone and post-iPhone so what you're saying I think is right on the money it's simply empirically observing both our past and looking at different historical cultural shifts that take place sometimes without us even realizing it but yeah it's a continuity and what a privilege to be to be alive in this age where we can both know more about the ancient world than some of the ancients knew and we can know more about the you know next steps then certainly anybody at this anybody before us and so what an exciting time to both dream and be nostalgic but like an Israeli friend of mine said once even nostalgia is not what it used to be what a treat to be in the room with someone who's one of the people I know who knows the most about where things are going next and to be in the room with one of the people I know who knows the most about where we've been in the past it's really fun to put you guys together and listen to what happened so thank you for hanging out thank you for indulging me with this conversation I thought it was fun it was amazing John thank you dr. Monson I'm grateful for your time and sorry sorry about the tiller oh no thanks for the thanks for the education and I just want to say again both of you you are just teaching people not only about the real world and about you know various frameworks of of belief and on you know worldviews but you're also I mean really doing a great service because you are you are one of the things that one of the big things that both of you do is you just you have this infectious love this this love for understanding and exploring and love for people and so you're teaching more than the content what you're doing you're teaching an approach and I am really thankful for that as is my family and quite a few people I know so keep it up yep I appreciate you buddy thanks I'll be in touch all right I'll see you later all right take care all right see you later thanks John thanks bye you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.74, "text": " Okay, what's up, man?", "tokens": [50363,
