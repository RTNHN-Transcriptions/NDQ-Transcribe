What is it? What's her name, Matt? I think that's right. I think I'm the guardian of memories. Oh, yeah. Sounds more epic. That's even more important. The guardian of memories. That's right. If that's not what you are, that's what you are now. That's right. Amy Lutz, guardian of memories is going to help us out. I had an assignment that I wanted you to teach me more about, and I've been reading about it as well. I think this will be less like the Amelia Earhart episode, which was literally the thing you did your thesis on. You were an expert at that. This is a little bit different, but if I understand correctly, the guy's name that I've asked you to research is Whittold-Pilecki. Am I saying that right? You are not saying that right, but you know what? You're close. You can't write in the American pronunciation. This is the extent of my Polish understanding, but his name is Whittold-Pilecki. That's how it's pronounced. Pilecki. Pilecki. Matt, you know about this guy, right? A little bit, but I'm here to learn. Okay. What I know about him, there's a soft spot in our hearts here at Nodum Questions for Poland. Specifically, Poland military. They're Polish military history. And that came from the wing to SARS, the famous charge in the siege of Austria. The Austrians were, yeah. We like Polish military history, but this is a really interesting one because help me out again, Amy. Whittold-Pilecki. There you go. You got it. Pilecki. So that's how I say it. Spelled W-I-T-O-L-D-P-I-L-E-C-K-I. So Mr. Pilecki did an amazing thing. It's my understanding that he is one of the only people to voluntarily enter into a concentration camp in... Concentration camp, yeah. He signed up for the big one too, right? He voluntarily went to Auschwitz. Correct. So he's known as the only person to volunteer to go into Auschwitz. There's actually one other example of a British prisoner of war named Dennis AV who did not volunteer to go into Auschwitz but volunteered to go into a portion of Auschwitz where the Jewish prisoners were kept. So AV had already been imprisoned and he volunteered to go to another part in the camp because it was such a huge complex. But W-Told-Pilecki is the only person that we know about who voluntarily allowed himself to be arrested so he would be sent to that camp. Well, he did it before it was cool. Cully. That's awful. That's the thing. We can't make any jokes in this episode, right? It's tough to do. What are we going to do? What do you do? We're talking about World War II and we're talking about the Holocaust and this is awful stuff and Amy, you actually work at a Holocaust museum. I do. What is the name of the Holocaust museum you work at? The St. Louis Kaplan Feldman Holocaust Museum in St. Louis, Missouri. So Matt, I have a question for you. Have you ever been to a concentration camp in Germany? Have you done the visit tours or anything like that? No, not in. I've been there but not in. I've had a few days of just driving around the country so I can describe the outside but I've not toured one. What's the outside look like? Bleak. Okay. In some ways it reminded me of some of the little forts that you see scattered around the American Midwest. It's that era of architecture. It looks somewhat brick industrial in nature. It looks sturdy. Yeah. It looks like an old abandoned fort. I guess. Amy, you're more equipped. That actually sounds pretty accurate. I have not been to a concentration camp myself or anywhere near one but many of these camps, including Auschwitz, were actually previously prisoner of war camps, internment centers, prisons and so it would make sense that that's a bit of what they look like from the outside. At least the ones that are still remaining. There were a number that were actually plowed under by the Nazis as they were retreating. Oh really? I've actually been to one. I went to Dachau. So in Germany. Yes, in Germany. Complete surprise to me, my friend that I was traveling with in Germany, we were meeting with the German military on some rocket stuff and then we had a free day and I'm like, hey, what do you want to do? We're over here. We could just go anywhere. He's like, I'd like to go to Dachau. I was like, Dachau, that sounds pretty cool. Let's go there. I didn't know what Dachau was. We got off the train and he told me it was a concentration camp and I was like, whoa, that's heavy. We arrive and you walk through the gates and you see, forgive me, I don't know how to pronounce this, our baked, our baked, much freer. A brick mark fried. See, I should know this but I know exactly what you're talking about. It says work will make you free. Correct. Is that? Yeah. And there's something very striking about that moment when you walk into the camp because you realize that there was a lot of effort to make this sign to make me feel a certain thing when I walk through this gate. It's like the whole place is engineered to make me feel something and it's not good. And as soon as I walked in, I realized and it was lost on me at the time that I did not have to walk far from the railroad station to the camp. They were right next to each other and I never connected the dots as to why they were right next to each other. And so I didn't have to rent a car or take a taxi or anything. I just walked off the train over to, through the gate and it was a, it was a solemn moment. And so when you walked in, everything you described, Matt, all that brick, you know, that oppressive, it was worse than brutalism. And I think it's because you know what happened there but it was a really, really weird feeling. So I don't know, it struck me and it's something that you never forget ever. I'm sure and it's interesting. You mentioned the work will make you free sign outside. So Dachau was the first concentration camp built by the Nazis. It was established in March of 1933, which is actually two months after the Nazis take control. So if that gives you an idea of their priorities, they set up one of the camps about two months later. 1933. 1933. So Hitler becomes Chancellor January 30th, 1933. And then by March, they are forcing political prisoners. Those are the first prisoners in concentration camps into Dachau being the first one. And Auschwitz, which we'll talk about more today, they took that sign from Dachau. That same sign is at the gate of Auschwitz as well, which is of course a much larger, well-known camp in Poland. What a weird thing to think about. You know, presidents are always into talking about what they'll do and they're always evaluated by their first hundred days. That falls within his first hundred days, like, hey, keeping my campaign promises. I got one of those concentration camps I mentioned up and running. That's what success looks like. The stuff you do in your first hundred days in office is meant to satisfy your constituents to say, I heard why you voted for me and I did the things you asked me to do. And look, you can count on me. I am your guy. The fact that it happened within the first hundred days, I think means something. Oh, oh, absolutely. I didn't do the math. Did it happen within the first hundred days? Technically, I mean, if you, you know, so end of January is when they take, take control, 28 days in February. Oh, absolutely first hundred days. First hundred days is probably now I'm going to go back and do this math later in my head. But May or June of 33. And by that point, not only had Dachau been established, but the initial anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish pieces of legislation had already been passed on April 1st, 1933. The Nazis launched a nationwide boycott on Jewish goods and businesses. So that also tells you what they're doing right away when they take power. Okay. So I did not know this. I thought it was more of a gradual, like, boil the frog really slow. But like once the power is established and they've consolidated the power, then the secret police follow and it's just a, it just happens quickly. Don't need to boil anymore. Yeah. So it's both. So in Germany, the situation for German Jews is much different than what it later becomes for Polish Jews, which we'll talk about. And so while the Nazis did begin anti-Jewish actions pretty early, it was more gradual than you would expect. And so there's the boycott. There's the civil service law in which Jews were expelled from the civil service, also teaching positions. Jewish students are expelled from schools in 1935 or the Nuremberg laws in which German Jews lose their citizenship. It bans marriages between quote unquote, Arians and Jews. And so it starts early, but the events that we probably most often associate with the Holocaust, the, you know, the gas chambers, the massive deportations to camps like Auschwitz, those actually don't start for Jews until much later. Political prisoners like V told Puletsky are some of the first people interned in camps in 33. Wow. Okay. So where do you want to go from here, Matt? We want to learn about this guy. We want to learn about what happened. What do you think is a good place to start? Well, I have a question to start with. Why would someone voluntarily check themselves into a concentration camp? So that's a great question. And I'm hoping we can kind of stumble upon an answer as we're going through here, but V told Puletsky. So let's move forward to 1939. We were just talking about 1933. So he was actually born in, in Russia, in the Soviet Union, but ends up in, in Poland several years later, because around this time, Jews in Eastern Europe were constantly being pushed out of certain cities, pushed out of certain nations and moved elsewhere. And there was a very large Jewish population in Poland. And so he and his family is Puletsky a Jew. No, he's not. He's actually Catholic, but he was witnessing all of those expulsions at that time. And once he sees other things happen in the camp later, he has some kind of preliminary understanding of what's happening. But no, he was Catholic. And so he and his family, he was married with two kids end up in Poland. He actually fought in the First World War with Poland. And in the Second World War, actually in the lead up to the Second World War, he starts operating in the underground resistance in Poland. And so I'm curious if you guys know this, but as you probably do know, Germany invades Poland in September 1939, thus beginning the Second World War. Do you know what the Germans did to argue that invading Poland was justified in August 1939? Oh, man. This was in my making of the atomic bomb book because all of the scientists, there were several of them that were Jewish and they were freaking out when the civil service laws were passed. And then like they started realizing it was getting hot and then no, I don't know the answer. But then what's the name of the priest that starts with the B that I read about? Bonhoeffer. Thank you. Yeah, I was in that book as well. But I don't remember because I'm a poor student of history. Matt, do you know? No, I'm all ears. I just rang my Jeopardy buzzer and I failed. Do you have a match? I will pass to Amy. All right, I do have an answer. So as you've alluded to, although most of the pieces of anti-Jewish legislation and the escalating oppression is happening in Germany later, Austria, the Sudetenland as which was in former Czechoslovakia as the third Reich, the Nazi Germany expands their growth. Hitler and the top leaders of Germany always had their eyes on Poland. We don't have to go too much into this, but if you've heard the phrase Liebenschram, they wanted living space for their expanded nation and they considered that to be in Poland. A lot of Nazis also had this very racial ethnic hatred of Poles, not just Jews, but Poles and ethnic groups in the east. And so this was a plan for quite a while. And so of course there were rumblings in Poland that this would happen, but the Germans, ever the propagandists, didn't want to just, quote unquote, randomly invade. They wanted to at least claim that there was some sort of reason for doing so. And so in late August, 1939, they staged a fake attack on a German radio station on the border of Germany and Poland. And so they actually, this is really awful. They dressed up concentration camp prisoners in Polish-esque military uniforms and then staged a quote unquote fake attack between those prisoners and German SS officers. And so they're claiming to the world after this happens that the Polish military had attacked Germany and then they invade Poland the next day. Nothing like that has ever happened since, right? No, that's never happened. Like that's something only a Nazi would do. That's not the kind of thing that somebody else would do. Nobody's as bad as the Nazis. So it's just weird how far fetched it seems. When something that looks like it could be a false flag happens and somebody throws out like, are we sure? Everybody's like, well, that's crazy. No, that's absolutely ludicrous. Those don't happen except for when they do. And I guess that's a pretty good example of one of the times that we know that it did. How do we know for sure that it did and that it wasn't actually the Poles though? It's a lot of different reasons. I mean, at the time, the best that I can tell very few people actually believe this was a real attack because why would Poland actually do something like that? The Nazis were also very good record keepers, which ends up getting them in trouble much later. And so there are records of what they did. Of course, later the people who were killed were identified as obviously not being Polish. I mean, anyone who looked closely at this quote unquote attack is pretty obvious what actually happened. Side note about the record keeping thing. I was in the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas, which is a really cool aerospace museum. They have a full on V1 and V2, the terror weapons that Hitler had made. And they had some of the documents, the records that were kept about this specific V2 that you're looking at at this museum in front of you. And it's amazing. Like they kept very, very detailed notes on like to the engineering standards that most people aspire to today. It's very impressive. So I cannot imagine the kinds of things that they did like, you know, memos or I don't know what the communication method of choice was back in the day. Did they have a fancy word for memo? I'm sure there's a very long German word for it, but I do not know what that is. Which Matt will say now. Memogrufen glaensk\u00fch. No problem. Thank you. Thank you for that. But this will come up as we're talking. But as you can imagine, when Nazis will go away into the future now, go on trial in 1945 and after they didn't have much to say because everything was on paper in their own words. Oh, wow. Mm hmm. Man. Goodness gracious. Hey, this episode of Notum Questions is brought to you by Audible. Audible makes audio books and we listen to tons and tons and tons of audio books and they got about a 11 billion titles on there. So pretty much whatever I've wanted to get. I've been able to get. What are you listening to right now, buddy? Right now I am listening to the completed autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Oh. At the request of my father, he said, Hey, here's the deal. This is the next audio book you're going to listen to. And I said, Yes, sir. And I'm listening to it. And I'm actually kind of struck by how distant Benjamin Franklin is to his children. He said, Oh, well, I came home after this trip and I was informed that my daughter was engaged. And I was like, what? Oh, what do you mean? You're not that was a trip where he was in France. Yeah, he was in France. He also was in England for quite a while. There's just a lot. I mean, he did a lot of traveling. He's a goofy cat. Yeah. Like forward thinking and clever and he gets credit for all of that, but eccentric and weird. I think you could also apply those titles to him. Yeah, he's very different in different parts of his life. He thinks a lot about being industrious and frugal and stuff like that. But anyway, what are you listening to? Well, I am about to get started on the Hobbit and I'm going to do the Andy circus version. Oh, really? You did not listen to that version, correct? No, I did not. The deal here is that we do an audible book club with an audiobook that we take turns picking and then we do an episode about it. And last time around, we did Getting to Yes by the gentleman who wrote Getting to Yes. That one was the guy. Yes, exactly. I think we both remember him and how good the book was. Completely. Completely. And this time around, I do remember the name of the author. I have picked The Hobbit by J.R.R.R. Tolkien and I am excited to put all of our adult eyes on it because I'm guessing we haven't given that a careful look since we're kids. And I'm eager to put adult ears on it because I'm guessing we haven't read this book or listened to this audiobook since most of us were much younger. And so I'm excited to revisit it and see what's going on there. If it's just a kid's story or if there's something more cooking, either way, I'm intending to enjoy it greatly. And as I mentioned, I'm going with the Andy Serkis version. That's the guy, the narrator I'm going with. He's the guy who, of course, is famous for... I have no idea. What's he famous for? Really? No, I don't know. Well, he's the guy who played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. Is he really? Yeah. So all of your Gollum voices in The Hobbit are going to sound a lot like you're used to the Gollum voice sounding. Wow. That's cool. I had no idea. Listen to the Rob English version. Okay. And it's fantastic. And what's so interesting about it is he sings the songs and it's fantastic. So yeah, the songs are not just written. They're sung to you. And they're sung to you in a way that makes you feel like you're at the party. It's amazing. Okay. I don't know if Andy Serkis is going to sing or not. I don't know. Now I feel conflicted. So you listen to that one. I'm going to listen to the Andy Serkis one. Let's just have everybody listen to whichever one they want. I can tell you this. The Rob English version has been praised as like the version. Like it's amazing. And I read somewhere that Tolkien himself approved of the way the songs went down. I don't know if that's true or not. When did Tolkien die? Is that even possible? Mid-century? Maybe a little later? Yeah. So how old is Rob English? I have no idea. What I really like is he has a different voice for each type of person. So you've got the trolls, you've got the dwarfs, you've got the... What did the dwarfs sound like? He does a good job of making them feel large. I'm sorry. I wasn't meaning to give the impression I was asking about how it felt. What I was trying to ask was what do they sound like? Oh. Understood. Oh, I'm a big troll and I'm going to just do something very troll-like. My voice is deep. That makes sense. My voice is really deep so you can tell that I'm larger than the habits. You talk like this. Wait, how did the habits sound? Go, go, go. Bilbo always sounded like this when he was talking. Okay. Yeah. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sold. That was good. Rob English does a really good job and I think he does really good with Gollum as well. I'm really impressed at how well you did it jumping between those yourself. Maybe you should do an audiobook. Yeah, exactly. What would you narrate if you were narrating audiobooks? I'd like to narrate something that has a whole bunch of different goofy voices. I think fantasy would be where you'd be fun to narrate a song of Fire and Ice book. That'd be real cool. I think what's so cool about the Hobbit is there's so many different types of characters. And so you've got, I mean, even the Eagles, you've got, what's the, the Bears name born? I mean, you have all these different types of characters and he just switches in between. So I'd be interested to hear what your, your take is on your narrator. What was the name again? Andy Serkis. Andy Serkis. Okay. And I got the Rob English version. So I think that in itself will be a great part of the discussion. So I look forward to that. Excellent. Likewise. Can I throw out a bonus book recommendation just as a sidebar here because of what we're talking about today? Yeah. I don't want to muddy the water, but there's a book that I read back in the day called Why the Allies Won by Richard Overy. I remember thinking it was fantastic. I have not listened to the audiobook. It is narrated by a guy named Nelson Rungar, but this was such a comprehensive breakdown of why the allies shouldn't have won and how in this one flooky way they did. When I watched Infinity War for the first time Avengers Infinity War, yeah, you remember the scene where Dr. Strange is twitching and fidgeting and what he's like, what's he doing? And then he comes back out of the trance. He's like, I just envisioned 11 billion, 521 realities. And Tony's like, how many did we win in? And he holds up the one finger. We only won in one version. When I saw that scene, I thought of why the allies won. I thought, man, there's about a bajillion ways that the allies lose World War II and they walk us very carefully through why in this one very narrow, difficult to obtain version of reality, the allies actually ended up winning the thing. And I think when people are done with the conversation that it looks like we're about to have with Amy, they will appreciate why a book like that might fit for today's conversation. Can I throw one in here? Absolutely. Yeah, there's an audiobook I listened to called Bonhoeffer, Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy. It's by Eric Metaxas, and it's amazing. It's really, really good. And yeah, we referenced Bonhoeffer later here in this conversation with Amy, but I think it was a fantastic book. And it gave me a little bit of insight into the stress that people's lives were under. So audibles changed my life. So we have a promo code, right? Yeah, we do. And the promo code is pretty slick because it doesn't just get you access to a title as you're getting started. It gets you access to what Audible really has really been putting a ton of emphasis on. And that is this expanded catalog, what they call the plus catalog. They have more than audiobooks. They've got audio titles, as I guess, what they're calling them now because there's all kinds of stuff, theatrical performances, wellness programs, podcasts that I don't think you can get in a lot of other places, comedy stuff. There's a whole bunch of other things. And so signing up this way for Audible gets you access not just to their very impressive catalog that we're always talking about, but to this extended plus catalog as well. And the way you get that is by going to audible.com slash ndq or you can just text ndq, notum questions, ndq to 500 500. And it'll get you up and running on your mobile device. Yeah, and this expanded catalog that you're talking about has tons of stuff you can listen to. For example, this Ben Franklin autobiography, I just got it. Didn't use one of my Audible credits to get it. It was just in there. Yeah. So I just go for it. So there's a ton of stuff to listen to. I'm listening to so much Audible that I'm using my credit every month and I'm looking in that extra catalog to see what else I can listen to. And it's working out great for me. So audible.com slash ndq or text ndq to 500 500. Little link will just pop up on your phone. Click that. Go pick which version of the Hobbit you want to listen to. So you'll be ready for the discussion that we're going to have about the Hobbit. So I've got the Rob English version. I've got the Andy circus version and audible has been a friend of the program for ages. And I'll hold a bunch of you from the third chair. I've got connected with audible as a result of them hanging out with us here. And we appreciate them and we appreciate you supporting the sponsors. All right. Interesting. So we invaded Poland. Nothing Germany invaded Poland. Easy with the we know we did not in vay. Careful. I don't ever want to invade Paul. The Nazis. Have you seen what they do to outsiders? Okay. Do you hear about Vienna? Yeah, I heard about that. Okay. Cool. That was that was bad. Let's just say that didn't happen. All right. Nazis invaded Poland. And at that point, where is Puletsky? So he is he almost immediately jumps in to be part of this underground resistance organization. And he actually with other members of this organization start making their way to Warsaw. And as you can possibly imagine in the chaos of everything going on right now, they don't know where they are or what's happening. But it's pretty quick. I'll also add they didn't have a radio at the time with them. And so this is just a bunch of underground resistance fighters just walking through Poland, trying to collect it. So Amy, you don't meet you're not talking about right now. Like, oh, in the first few weeks, he got mobilized, mobilized. You're talking about like stuff started happening and he started very quickly, almost immediately. This is instant. This is real time. Absolutely. Almost immediately. He and his he and his family were not only very proud Catholics. They were very proud Poles. And so it was never really a question for him whether or not he would defend his own nation. It was just just jumped in right away. And the Nazis take over Poland very quickly actually within about three weeks they take Warsaw. So during that time, he is actively part of some of this this resistance effort. The last resist at least public resistance from Polish resistors ends in I think October 6th. So it's a very, very quick turnover. And we talked about what 10 minutes ago about the gradual implementation in Germany of these laws against the Jews. So Polish Jews, although there was a suspicion that something like this was happening and not just Polish Jews, Poles, all Poles, they did not have that gradual notification in the same way that Germany did. So within three weeks, the Nazis not only have taken over the nation, but they're implementing a series of anti Polish and anti Jewish pieces of legislation very, very quickly. And so someone like V told Puletsky, of course, is seeing this happen in the chaos of Poland. And he is actively part of the mostly underground resistance effort to collect information and disseminate intel about what is going on in Poland. Okay. He died at 47 in 1948. So at this point, he's he's almost 40. Yes. Somewhere in his 30s. He's married has two kids. Oh, oh, really? He's married and has two kids. Yes. Holy cow. I don't know why, but that changes things for me to realize that God lead this guy's a man of action. And he is. And we'll talk about this specifically about why he went to Auschwitz, how he did it, but he actually does not tell his wife and children what he's doing because he wanted to give them plausible deniability in case Nazi or Nazi collaborators came to their door and asked them where he was. And so they're generally aware of maybe some of the resistance efforts he's doing, but kept mostly in the dark about about what he's doing. So, so during this time, as you can possibly imagine, he becomes relatively well known in this underground world. And there are rest warrants out for him. And so he spends quite a bit of time, you know, kind of trying to escape from the law. But I don't know if you know anything about this courier system that the underground put together. So they, one of the first things that they do is they put together this courier system where they try to get information out of Poland to Switzerland to, you know, France at this point because France had not yet been invaded, eventually to Great Britain to get information out about what was happening. So he's an active part of that. And one of the pieces of information that comes through that system is information that in August 1940, so this is several months later, August 1940, a group of Polish political prisoners were imprisoned in Auschwitz. So they were aware that this camp existed. Auschwitz was in Nazi occupied Poland. All six of what we call the death camps were in Nazi occupied Poland simply because that's where the greatest Jewish popular, the largest Jewish population was. Now it wasn't just Jews imprisoned in these camps, but it was primarily Jews later. We'll talk about that when we get to it. But anyway, there's this information circulating that to this group of basically prisoners of war had been imprisoned in Auschwitz and then shortly after their families received a telegram that they had all died. And it just seems very suspicious. So the first travel very quickly through underground organizations like this. And so there's a lot of talk bubbling up about what is going on in this camp. And so that's where V told starts thinking someone needs to go in and figure out what's going on. And so he ends up being that person. There's there's a discussion within some of the leaders of the organization about, you know, who it should be. And he ends up actually volunteering to go into Auschwitz. It's the same exactly to get information about what's going on because the only way they feel like they can get accurate information is to have someone on the inside. How old were his children? Do we know this? Not off the top of my head, but they were fairly young. I believe they were younger than 10. He's all in. Mm hmm. All in, like I said, does not tell his wife, his children do not know that he plans on doing this. So as I mentioned, you know, there are people looking for him because he's well known as being part of this organization. And he ends up basically volunteering to become arrested. He kind of turn, you know, makes it known where he is, turns himself in and ends up basically smuggling himself, but you know, being arrested and sent Auschwitz in August 1940. It's not a good time to be in Auschwitz. Yes, not a good time. What I read is there was some kind of like street roundup in Warsaw and he just kind of went out into the street. Mm hmm. I mean, obviously I'm paraphrasing, but that's my understanding. Like he was conveniently in the place where they were gathering up these people. Correct. So, so the, the underground knew about this upcoming plan about this, this upcoming roundup. And he just, like you said, just happened to be there at the time. That was one of the pieces of information that circulated through the underground. And he ends up being one of the people arrested through that roundup. That's amazing. That means they probably had an informant on the, you know, embedded in the Nazis. I don't know who, but what's so interesting is we know about Bolesky, but there were probably other people doing this sort of thing that we don't know about. Absolutely. Absolutely. 100%. And I'm sure that they had some informants, a lot of it to be honest with bribery. They just bribed the right people. Got information. I wouldn't be shocked if that's how they found that out. But yes, lots of informants. This was a very well organized, but also very secret underground network. Now we'll talk about this when it comes to the camp, but the way that the Polish underground organized themselves was very similar to a lot of underground or secret organizations in that only one to two people usually knew everyone who was involved. Those people only knew the people surrounding them, the people that they had immediate contact with, but no one else in the chain of the underground. Therefore, if someone was arrested, they would not be able to turn in the entire underground. It would just be a handful of people. And so that's how the Polish underground worked. It's also how the underground within the camp worked as well, which is really smart on more than one level. When I used to see that kind of setup described in history books or see it in a movie, I'd say, oh, that's smart. Then you can't if you get tortured, you can't rat people out. But it's also very efficient on the other side. If Doug gets captured and you know, he absolutely has no influence beyond one person either way in the chain, you don't have to change what you're doing very much. You know exactly what you're doing. And so though Doug may never, ever, ever break, if he knows everything, you've got to change everything. Exactly. He'll just reach you in the game and keeps you efficient as well, even if you trust him implicitly. Yeah. So it was very efficiently organized. Legistically clever. Very, very logistically clever, as you said, and very efficiently organized. And so he ends up in the camp, you know, intentionally going in planning to smuggle out information. We'll talk about how specifically he does that. So Auschwitz at the time, we alluded to this earlier as we were talking about Germany, but although there were Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz at this time, they were not deported their wide scale until about 1942. And that's one of the things that Puletsky sees as he's in Auschwitz for about two and a half years, he sees the changing demographics of the camp. And so when he enters the camp, he's arrested, you know, in part because of the nature of his arrest, but he's he's arrested and sent to the camp primarily with other political prisoners. Most Jews are still in ghettos at this point. If there are any Jews in the camp, it's they're they're typically there because of their political affiliation, not because of their faith. That will change. But at this point, it's primarily a place for Polish political prisoners like Puletsky. Okay. So this boils my blood. Yeah. I want to crack jokes to keep it light because it somehow assuages the every aspect of what my morality is based around. And I'm not saying it's flawless with just who I am is appalled by Nazism by what happened here. This ticks every box of what I find to be ethically repugnant. It angers me even listening to the story. I watch movies or portrayals of these events. And I don't know what to do with the emotions that I feel when I watch it, whether it's portrayed even in fiction or in some kind of historical nonfiction. It affects my ability to have a simple conversation because I don't know what to do because I'm you feel powerless, ragingly angry, even listening to this account. Yeah, I think that's a universal feeling. I think are you familiar with Godwin's law? Matt, sure. Yeah. Amy, you've heard of Godwin's law. Very, very familiar, yes. Yeah. So basically it means as more and more discussion grows online in a place, the likelihood that a reference to Nazis or Hitler becomes more and more likely, I think that thing you're feeling right now is universal. Everybody. I've never seen anybody that this doesn't just make them furious. And it's incredible. And it's not only universal. It's that feeling that you're having. It's the reason I work at a Holocaust museum. So I've had the same feeling about studying this over years and years and years when I was an undergraduate, when I was in grad school. And for me, I'm the type of person where when I feel those, I have to do something with it. Like I have to do something. And so my moral imperative was I have to tell people about this. I have to tell people about this and we have to find a way to create a better world that doesn't look like what happened during the 1930s and 1940s. And we won't talk about this yet. I would ask for you to prepare yourself when we get to the point about or we get to the topic of how the world reacted to what someone like V told Puletsky reveals. Because that's the thing that really boils my blood. I read that part. Yes. Yeah, I will go into it because we'll talk about it. I don't know that I'm prepared to talk about that, but it's yes, I'm with you. Yeah. So we'll get to that. But as we're going through, obviously this is not the most enjoyable topic, but it's important. It's really important. And I think someone like V told Puletsky his heroism shines even brighter when you realize the horror that he was surrounded by. Because I mean, I look at a story like this and I think how in the world does someone do what he did? I mean, just to start with checking himself in, getting himself arrested and sent out fits. I mean, man, I got to tell you, I'd be hiding in my closet or something. I mean, it's just the level of bravery. We'll talk about that as we head through. He hit it head on, didn't he? Absolutely. He's like, hey, here's the thing. Someone told me one time that they were talking to a guy that has been in actual combat. We could talk to Lee about this, I'm sure. But he said that if you come up against an oppositional force, people are going to be injured and there's going to be casualties. But your unit has the highest likelihood of surviving if you hit it head on. If you just go straight at and you just hit the... I mean, I don't know that that's universally true, but they said that you have a much better chance instead of just going into deflate if you actually engage the threat. And it seems like that's what this guy was doing. He's like, I'm all in. 100% 100% I mean, it gets... So it's what can men do against such reckless hate? Right out in the... Right out in the... Right out in the... What's that from? Lord of the Rings. It's Aragorn. I'm sorry. Amy, when I said that, where's it from? You looked at me with very, very disappointed eyes. Did you say that? Shut mental. This is like, what's wrong with you, monster? We had been talking about Nazis, but that... So say it again. What can men do with such hate? Right out and meet them? What can men do against such reckless hate? Right out with me. Right out and meet them. It's the defeated king who asks the question, what can men do against such reckless hate? It's Theoden, who... I mean, his name has Theos in the name. It's intentional. It's the broken spirit of what the author views as being a now dormant, tired, worn out understanding of virtue and justice and Aragorn, the... Well, young looking, but old ranger is trying to motivate him to do the one thing that makes sense when that kind of evil manifests. And it's what you just said, Destin. Go right at it. Right out with me. Make them. Don't put your eyes down. Don't be discouraged. Chin up, eyes up, sword ready. Meet evil and engage it. I got chills when you said that. That was cool. That was cool. Yeah. That's all. That resonates with me. I just hope that if something like that were to ever happen, I won't... Well, I don't hope. I wonder if I were to have that amount of courage to be able to do that because you think you have a certain set of ideals, but like if I've never been tested like that, I've been in some moments where weird things happen and I discovered about myself that I ran towards danger in certain moments and other moments. I'm like, oh, just let them handle that. So I just wonder what would happen if it ever got real. And I found that those questions are really, really important because in my studies, I focus on rescue and resistance and things like what BeTold Puletsky did. And I ask myself the same question every time of what I have done. And I also, to be honest, I come up short. I think I don't know. My answer is I don't know. And you really don't know until you've been tested, but the fact that I don't know what my answer to that question is actually inspires me to be a better person. Inspires me to try to be the person who would do something like that, even if something... This seems unattainable, but to at least considering those questions is such a good first step to really doing a very difficult but important self analysis of what you might do during a situation like this. My wife is scared of snakes. That's valid. When I say scared of snakes, Matt, you saw there at the reptile museum or whatever it was. Yeah. That was not a joke. That was real. She did not... We tried to hide from her that she was walking under a python that was loose. That did not go well. No. I've always wondered, this is a test I will not run because I love my wife, but I've always wondered what would happen if I were to take when the kids were small. They were like two years old. I wanted to take a big rubber snake and wrap it around my daughter and then just observe my wife walking to the room. That is a paradox. What do you do? Yeah, you should not do that. Certain danger, certain danger thing I love. In this case, Puletsky was like, okay, certain danger, Poland that I love. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, he's protecting the nation. He's protecting his freedom. And by the way, he's protecting his family, doing what he did. When he answers the camp, I mean, this will give you an idea of how long this camp was around and the number of people who entered it. His camp number was 4859. When people entered the camp, their names were taken from them, which is, of course, very dehumanizing and they were given a number. So he was there early enough in the camp that he was not actually tattooed. He received basically a tag with his number on it. Later on, Auschwitz would tattoo that number, as most people know, on the arms of prisoners. Auschwitz was actually the only camp that did that. It was not every camp. It was just Auschwitz. And I actually looked this up right before we got on. Once everything is said and done after the camp is liberated in January of 1945, the camp assigned more than 400,000 prisoner numbers during the time that it was open. And so his number was 4859. So you can imagine how many numbers were assigned after that. Yeah. Wow. The people who were immediately sent to their death when they arrived at the camp typically were not given numbers. And so there were far more than 400,000 people in that camp during its operation. You mean they got off the train and they went straight to the chamber and they didn't go? They go through something called selection, which is a very difficult process that we'll kind of have to wait for later in the story. Well, let's do it. Let's go. Well, where are we at now? All right. Let's keep. So he's in the camp. He's in the camp. Got the number 4859 and he is forced to participate in real backbreaking labor. So he, you know, to be honest, he's moving rocks around in a wheelbarrow. They basically have prisoners building the camp itself, you know, building reinforcements later building the gas chamber and the Crete crematorium about two years after this. He works at a local bakery at one point, you know, baking bread. But the prisoner just forced in really, really tough labor. Priests and Jews in the camp were subject to the worst treatment, not that the treatment was great for anybody, but they were subject to the worst. And as you can possibly imagine, people did not live very long. I got to think of, think of it off the top of my head, but in most labor camps. So Auschwitz was a combination camp. So later they have the death camp, a transit camp, which is just where people were held before they were sent elsewhere and a, well, on a concentration camp and a labor camp. So this was a huge facility and he's in a labor portion. And the average lifespan of someone in that position was only about a few months because they got very little food. Typhus was rampant. We'll talk about how they use that to their advantage later. You know, they're certainly not given enough food and support to survive. And so extremely, extremely difficult conditions in the camp at this time. What did they understand the reason at this point in the game? What did the prisoners understand the reason for them being in the camp to be? So that changes as time goes on. At this point, the best that we can tell is that they thought that they were just, you know, they were in a prison and forced to participate in labor. Now, as the labor gets worse and worse, Vytole actually writes down and he says he starts to believe that this was the Nazi's method of killing political prisoners, just literally work themselves to death. But when they arrive, they think that they're in this horrible prison and then things become more clear, the longer prisoners are there. But in prison because they stole something and they were wrongly accused in prison because of ideological crimes in prison because they pose a threat, what would have been the assumption of your average inmate early on? Yeah. So early on ideological reasons that they were, you know, someone who I'd be told was actively trying to defend and wanting an independent Poland, actively resisting the Nazis. And so political opponents of the Nazis at this point were typically imprisoned. And so for political ideological reasons is why they would assume that they were there at this point. Like the Uighurs. Yeah. We could go down that tree. But yeah, I mean, well, the Uighurs are mostly in camp for religious reasons. That's a whole other reason. That's an idea. But in China, yeah. So right now there are people that are being sent to insert whatever term you want to call it, whether it be a prison or a reeducation camp or whatever, it's happening. And there's not great understanding from the Western world what exactly is going down. I have to believe that there is some type of resistance going on. And I have to believe that the things that we're reading about right now when it comes to Puletsky, I have to believe there's some of these things going on. If there's, I don't know, I don't know enough about the situation to speak to it, but I can imagine it's very interesting to you guys because I know the types of people you are in significant corporations, our biggest and best and wealthiest are entertainment corporations are catering to the desires of the government that's doing it. And right now, you feel a little bit of what it must have felt like back then, like you don't really want to say anything about what other governments are doing. Because everybody wants to play nice. You don't want to jab the bear. But yes, political religious minorities are suffering this fate right now. And we're seeking to get along better with the government that's doing it for economic benefit. And I find that troubling and I don't care who that offense. Well, and I think about this a lot actually because there is a, you know, historical parallels are difficult sometimes to make, but there is an important parallel here because the best that I can tell, obviously, as you said, we don't know everything that's going on. And I call them concentration camps. The Chinese government calls them reeducation centers, which of course is just propaganda. But one of the biggest things that people are doing to basically resist what's happening is get information out about it. So people who are formerly in the camps have gotten out and are giving interviews or if they have relatives in the camps. And one of the things that just chills me as we've kind of alluded to is the fact that we know what's going on over there. I mean, we might not know everything, but we know that something very bad is going on. And as you said, that there are these huge corporations basically making money off of slave labor. And we're just sitting over here in the United States like, you know, living our own lives. And so it, it, I think of this question all the time about what can we do in the West and elsewhere, you know, outside China to resist something like that, which was a very similar question that people had during the Holocaust. Well, some of the aspects of the worst portions of the Holocaust were not hugely known until after liberation. It was, it was printed in American newspaper. So that that boycott on Jewish goods I talked about in 1933, that was all over the American newspapers as were the increasing incidents in Germany. And obviously people resisted and that's a whole different discussion, but it does bring up lots of questions for me about what we're doing today to resist actively ongoing genocide and oppression. Wow. And it's kind of an all or nothing, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. What are we going to do? Invade China. Exactly. It's like, what can we do as individuals? That's, that's your option. It's like in for a penny in for a pound. If you want to go stop that guns are blazing, get ready for unbelievable collateral damage. And so I understand the moral math equation that everybody has had to do in all of the centuries of the mega state and this massive centralization and potential for this kind of violence and this kind of evil. You've got states that aren't doing it and want to be on the side of what is good and right. You got states that take their turns doing it and it's really difficult to stop. And it's like it has to get enough leash before you can develop the political will or moral courage to go and do something about it because it's unbelievably expensive. The BSA symmetry principle applies here. I mean, in order of magnitude, more energy to stop what the Nazis are doing than what it took for them to do it. No, that's not even that's not even enough. It's more than an order of magnitude to go and stop what they were doing. More than order of magnitude, more energy. I mean, what kind of energy would it take to stop what China is doing right now? I don't know. I don't like that our response is cater to it. I can live with maybe the collateral damage is too great and we're running a math equation that's bigger than above my pay grade and that I can't understand. I have a real moral gripe with cater to it and play along because it's financially beneficial to people who virtue signal left and right about how bad things like that are. Again, don't care who that offense. We can give back to your story though. Forgive me. So you're certainly not offending me, but there's there's a good segue into this story because Puletsky's answer to that was, you know, what do I do about this is to actively involve him, you know, to sneak himself into a concentration camp and report on it. So the underground was very focused on intelligence gathering and disseminating that information because what they believed was if they got information out about what was happening in camps, what was happening to to polls to Jews to a wide variety of people that the West specifically Great Britain would have to act because at this point it's 1939. The United States is not in the war yet. So they're primarily thinking of well, not France anymore because they had already been invaded, but primarily Great Britain's response. And so a big task within the camp. He has two tasks. One of his tasks is to get information out and another task is to improve the morale of prisoners in the camp because you can imagine how awful morale probably is. You know, a lot of people don't understand what's happening to them. Yes, I can imagine. Yeah, I mean, here's the thing we almost can't imagine. Like we can guess, we can have a sense of what it is. I can imagine it was low. Yes, you can imagine it was not very good. So that's a big part of what he's doing. So when he gets in the camp, he starts recruiting and connecting with other prisoners. And one of the kind of secondary reasons he did that was that people involved in this resistance had something to fight for, had something to hope for. Whereas, you know, if you weren't involved, it was just day after day after day, hoping the next day was better, hoping that you were going to escape a firing squad, you know, whatever was happening. And so this was something that they could be part of. Psychological bolstering to counter psychological intentional demoralization. Absolutely. Absolutely. So it gave you a reason to exist and to not die and not give up. Absolutely. A reason to get up in the morning. A reason to, and we could get to do a whole discussion of why people lived, why people who, why, why the people lived, why the people who died died. To be honest, most of it was luck. Like people just happened to be in the right place at the right time or the wrong place at the wrong time. But there is an element of having hope and having something to live for that does bolster your ability to fight for your own life. And so that was a big portion of what they were doing. One of the first people he connects with in the underground is a doctor named Daring, who he knew during the underground in Warsaw. So Daring had been arrested about a month before, be told. And because he was a doctor, he was actually assigned to one of the sort of hospitals, medical units in the camp, which actually gave him a lot of access to help other prisoners. And now we won't get too much into Daring. He has a lot of, later he makes some choices that are a little bit more problematic because the Nazis put them in a position to do difficult things. But we'll, we'll put that aside for a second. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. I can imagine that. So laying at the feet of the Nazis. Yeah. And the Nazis had, had, were very good at psychological torture. They were very good at putting people in what we call choiceless choices situations where they really didn't have a choice. So one of the things that Daring is forced to do is to basically perform medical experiments on prisoners. Oh my goodness. Yeah. And so it was his belief that he should do it so he can continue helping other prisoners. We don't have to make a judgment on that because it's almost impossible to from 2021. But I can make a judgment on the people who made them do it. Absolutely. 100%. That's a really good way to say that. Like we don't have to make a judgment on that because it's impossible from where we're at. Absolutely. In post, I mean, yeah, I appreciate that. I do my best not to make moral judgments on these situations because we can't. We just don't know what that was like. Well, okay, to be clear though, just to make sure we're also talking about the same thing. But we are comfortable making a moral judgment against a group of people and loaded others on boxcars and shipped them off to be executed. Okay. So we're talking about the people who were put in compromising situations and we're acknowledging the difficulty of. Correct. Yeah. But I really, I really do appreciate that you take the time to clarify that because that's not a thing. I don't know. It's easy to cast judgment from my house with a refrigerator and air conditioning. So yeah, anyway, I'm sorry. No, that's totally fine. Not difficult to make moral judgments against the Nazis, but difficult to make judgments about what victims do to save their own lives because we just haven't been in those positions. And so. So this is during before all that. During is the guy's name? During D-E-R-I-N-G. Mm-hmm. Okay. So Pulitsky is interacting with during before he had to make those difficult decisions. Correct. Yeah. This is still around 1940. And so during is in the hospital unit. He does a lot of things to try to help other prisoners. He alters their paperwork to make it look like they're not as sick as they actually are. At one point, about a year or two later, Pulitsky actually ends up in the hospital with typhus. And during actively tried to keep him in there longer because one of the things that the Nazis would do is they would go into the hospital units and they would basically kill the sickest prisoners. As horrible as this is to say, draining the resources of the camp. And so someone like during was in a position to try to prevent that from happening as much as possible. Wow. You make a couple moral leaps and that becomes the logical thing to do. Exactly. Yeah. It doesn't take many moral leaps to do that. Yeah. Which gets to an interesting question of what resistance looks like in these camps. You know, when I say the word resistance, most people think of like armed resistance, like really active resistance. But sometimes the smallest things can be examples of resistance. So there's one point much later on where the underground network finds out that the Nazis are planning to basically liquidate one of the, you know, so-called hospitals in the camp. And so during and be told and some other people are running through trying to tell people to get away before they are loaded onto trucks and taken to gas chambers or elsewhere. And they actually save about a hundred people doing that because they got in front of it. So there's that, but there's also forms of spiritual and cultural resistance. You know, there's one point in my research, I came across a case of a number of Polish political prisoners being sent to their death and on their way there, they were singing the Polish national anthem. And that was their way of resisting what the Nazis were doing in their last final moments. You know, there were other people who chose to pray. You can do this to me, but you don't get my mind. Well, they chose to die with dignity. You don't get my soul. You don't get myself. Exactly. And so especially for Jewish prisoners, but for other prisoners as well, you know, praying, participating in any sort of religious service was not going to happen. And so even just making clandestine worship services was a form of resistance. And so you see that a lot in things like this. You see how people did what they could do to reclaim their dignity. Because as I said, you know, they get into the camp and their name is taken from them. Most of the time their head is shaved, especially for women. That's really, really humiliating. And so people did whatever they could do to try to survive. Like I think about what it was like for me when I shaved my head and realized that the hair thing wasn't going to be happening. And then I picture what that would be like to have someone forcibly do that to my wife. That's a different equation. Yeah, I'm built for it to intentionally strip her of something associated with beauty and not to say that hair is required to be a beautiful woman, but to willfully inflict that shame and that dehumanization. Yeah, I'm just going to get worked up again. Well, the thought was to do Laos, like it reduces the like there was a very analytical reason for that. And they're like, Oh, well, it's less likely to get lice. And so that's viewing humans as objects and as things to be managed rather than as the soul that they are pieces you move around on your chessboard, pieces that didn't sign up. That's how they argued it. I think that there were there were also very insidious reasons, but it's interesting you bring that up because this comes up and be told story in a form of another form of resistance. So typically men and women who arrived at the camp, but were forced into labor had their head shaved so that they couldn't transmit lice and lice being really the worst epidemic of the camp because lice transmit typhus, which could be very deadly and very rapid spreading. And so at one point, members of this underground group, including V told in Auschwitz, they end up stealing uniforms and actually like pulling lice off themselves and then breaking into I think it was an SS officers or the SS the place where they kept SS officers kept their uniforms and just threw lice on them. Heck yeah. To spread typhus to the SS officers. And there was at least one officer that I know of who died from typhus because of it. What is typhus do? I'm going to Google it real quick. So typhus known as typhus favors group of infectious diseases that include endemic typhus common symptoms include fever, headache and rash. Typically these begin two weeks after exposure and it's caused by type of bacterial infection. That doesn't sound pleasant. It not only does it not sound pleasant, but you can imagine this is 1940 and 1941. The medical advances are not what they are now and on top of that, these people are in a concentration camp. So they're certainly not going to have access to the type of medical care that they need or deserve at the time. And so that's a big reason why typhus was I mean it was absolutely frightening to the SS officers, which is in part why it was a genius idea to use lice as a form of resistance at the time. Wow. They happened at well I don't know that it was a resistance, but it was something that famously Corey Tenbooms more devout sister at Ravensbrook credited God for. I think God for the lice because he keeps the guards out of our barracks. And that was absolutely true at Auschwitz as well. I mean, there were times when there were massive epidemics going through the camps and guards would not even come close to prisoners, which in many cases may have saved some people's lives because it kept them separated from the authorities running the camp at the time. That's interesting because when you, you know, when I was reading about him organizing these little groups of five people that did the things they did, you know, inside the camp, I was like, well, how do they communicate without being spied on by the Nazis? Like how do they coordinate with other people and lice as part of that answer? That's lice is part is that accurate? I would say that's accurate. I think that's only one part of the answer. I mean, some other, you know, they would just communicate with people the best way that they could often in the middle of the night because they're certainly in their bunks. You weren't going to have SS officers there overnight. And so that would at least give them, give them some time to communicate. But you actually bring up an interesting question that we haven't talked about, which is, you know, so, so Pulletsky gets into this camp wanting to transmit information out about what's happening. And so that brings up the question of how he got information out. And he did that in a variety of ways. As we kind of alluded to earlier, the actual letters, there were letters sent from the camp from prisoners out to their families, at least for in the early years of the camp. Those were heavily censored. They were often sometimes completely faked. And so those were not going to be reliable ways to communicate to other people. However, at this time, especially for political prisoners, if if a prisoner's family pulled the right strings or bribed the right people, they could get released from the camp. And so one of the things that Pulletsky and others would do is they would identify who those people were, you know, just simply by rumors spreading throughout the camp. And when they found someone they felt could be trustworthy, they would give them the information often that people would have to memorize it, memorize the information, and then take it back to the undergrad resistance efforts in Warsaw and in wider Poland. So that was one way that they did it and really a primary way. They would find trusted Nazis. Trusted Nazi. No, no, trusted prisoners. So there were in the early days of the camp, there were prisoners at their family, bribed the right people, you know, bribed the right official. Those prisoners would get released. And so the network would. And so they're bribing people outside. Absolutely. Yes, I should be clear. They were bribing people outside the camp that pulled the right strings. OK, got it. So those prisoners would take take the information. There were also a series of escape attempts from outfits at the beginning. Puletsky is not a huge fan of them because this is a fairly well known subject, but most of the time after an escape attempt or after any sort of massive example of resistance, the Nazis, the SS officers in charge of the camps would stage retribution. You know, for every one person who escaped, they might kill 10. They might send a group of people to the gas chamber. I mean, really horrible things. And so someone like Puletsky at the beginning, now this changes a little bit. At the beginning, it was not a huge fan of the idea of escape attempts, of massive uprisings because he thought that the retribution would be much worse than anything that they could possibly do. However, that being said, he does change his mind. And so my favorite story of escape from Auschwitz, again, there's, there's only a few cases where this happened, but there were four prisoners. This was, boy, I don't know the year, but 41 or 42. There were four prisoners who staged this escape. And one of those prisoners was someone that Puletsky actually added to this group because he had certain access to, well, I'll tell you exactly what he had access in a second. But a couple of these prisoners, one of them worked on the SS officer's car. He had some sort of mechanical background and that was his job. Another prisoner known by Puletsky had access to the store room where they kept the uniforms. And so what these prisoners do, well, first off, they memorize the information that Puletsky has taken about the operation of the camp. And they sneak into the building where these uniforms are kept, dress up as SS officers, get to the car that this one prisoner had taken, and they drive the car out the front gate of Auschwitz and get away, all four of them. They actually, they, they, they do the Heil Hitler salute on the way out because the, the guards guarding the gate just assumed that those were probably, you know, SS officers. I mean, the odds of prisoners escaping in a car seemed so low that they were just able to get out. That was rare, though. That was, that was the only, the only case like that. And obviously there were, there were reprisals. I can't remember exactly what they were, but certainly reprisals for, you know, stealing a car of, of an officer. But cases like that, you know, I mean, during those rare escapes or prisoner releases, that's one way that V told would get the information out to the wider resistance effort. Now, I am unclear about exactly how this happened, but they were able to smuggle in and steal enough pieces to build a radio in the camp. You told me to research this and I didn't. Well, I'll tell you what I know about it. Okay. I'm so sorry. I was excited to research it and I, I failed to, because you got to figure out the frequency. Exactly. You got to figure out who's on the other side and they have to like be able to receive it. And this was not back in the day when they were recording spread spectrum. They actually had to like be ready with pencil in hand to write down whatever you're either saying or, you know, Morse code. Yeah. So this one was designed to transmit Morse code out to now the frequency they were on, how that worked. I have no idea, but they were able to build this kind of makeshift radio to transmit information out. There was another time where another member of the underground, I think it was during actually was able to get access to a radio and an SS officer's office. That was a way that they got information in. And so the BBC was technically banned at this time because obviously they're broadcasting information that the Nazis don't want out. But you can just tune to. Well, exactly. The Nazis tried to jam the signal, but were very unsuccessful about it. Doing that. And so that's one of the ways that information actually came into the camp was into the camp and into the broader underground and Poland and elsewhere was through the BBC, because the Nazis just did not jam it well enough. And so that's one of the ways that the information got in to the camp. What's so interesting is if you're going to communicate with someone, it has, you know, in order to have true communication, you need two way. So I need to be able to tell you something. And then you need to be able to be like, Oh, okay, I understand that. I acknowledge that I've received the information. And then I'm like, okay, I have successfully communicated. And so if I was in a camp and I had a transmitter, I would just use my dits and does. I spent this small amount of time. It was about six months. I had MP3s on a CD, you know, long time ago. And I would play Morse code in my car on the way to work every day and tried to learn Morse code. Such a goober thing to do. I'm a ham radio operator. On paper on paper, I'm a ham radio operator, but I've never actually communicated with Morse code. But you know, it's all voice now. But I don't know, you would just be tapping your dits and does to get out. And you just have to assume somebody got the information, like not knowing if somebody heard you would be awful. Well, and can you imagine how that would impact the morale about getting information out, hoping someone got it? You know, obviously some information came back in through Smuggled, you know, the Smuggled radio or the Access radio. Also other prisoners coming in. Sometimes for people who individuals in the camp knew and they could bring information in, there were quite a few ways that information came in and out. But this becomes very important in V-Told's work in terms of the type of information he's sending out and the impact he's hoping that it has. And so, you know, he's sending out things like what the camp looks like, the conditions of the camp. Really almost a historical narrative about what's happening. One of the things that he wanted to get out was the death toll in the camp. And he sits around thinking, you know, how am I going to know this? You know, he doesn't have access to the whole camp. But what he realizes is that he even writes that he realizes that the answer to that problem was written on the prisoners' arms and written on their numbers. He could look at the most recent numbers tattooed on prisoners' arms and then kind of mentally calculate how many prisoners were still in the camp. And that would tell him the number of people who had perished in the camp compared to the number that were there at the time. Because he had a feel for how many barracks there were. He did. He did. And obviously, he's communicating with this underground network and able to pull in that information. So that's one of the things that he's certainly transmitting out of the camp as well. As I mentioned, the Nazis were very good at keeping records. And so often, there were a couple cases where prisoners would be able to steal or sneak a peek at, you know, record books of some sort from SS officers and they would communicate that information out. And as V told us is collecting all of this information, one of the first things he hopes to convince, mostly the Royal Air Force, convince the British to do is to actually bomb the camp is to destroy the camp because it was worth doing to prevent the bloodshed. The problem is, and this is, you're going to know more about this than I do, there's a couple problems. First off, obviously, they never actually did it. But there's this rumor that goes throughout historians. So you can tell me the the accuracy of this that bombers at the time, especially British ones, had a very difficult time hitting their targets. And so there were concerns that, you know, if you were to bomb the tracks to Auschwitz, you might miss and hit prisoners as well. So that was one of the concerns. But that was something he was really urging people on the outside to do to try to convince the allies to bomb the camp. Like I said, it does not happen. Yeah. Can we do some role play real quick? Sure. I won't make it weird. Matt Captain Matt Whitman with the Royal Air Force, you just received intelligence from your radio operator that there is a a camp where a lot of Polish political prisoners are being executed daily. And you're also trying to fight like the war against the Nazis. What what do you do with this information? And I mean, you understand that there's an awful thing happening in this certain location. So why would you not bomb it? Why would you not try to do something with this information that Pulitsky has? Well, I can think of a couple reasons right at the top of my head. One, I'm not sure we have the technological capabilities to accomplish this if the information I'm getting is accurate. Secondly, what if the information is not accurate? We know that a false flag has just been employed to justify the invasion of Poland. How difficult would it be to false flag this intel to give the impression that this is the source it was coming from when in fact, this is something that's happening at the point of a bayonet and is coming my direction, it isn't accurate at all. What if we're dead wrong about what's going on in this space? And the third thing that I might think about would be, we have no ground presence on the continent at all. So we bomb some stuff. What's that going to actually accomplish? And people could run for the hills, they'll just be rounded back up, the reprisals will be massive. Strategically, I'm thinking to myself, well, if this is an actual communication, I understand why someone in the camp would think that this is what we ought to do next. But if I actually want to solve the problem, I need to come up with strategic maneuvers that will allow us to back up whatever we accomplish in the air. Board gaming rule 101 is you can't occupy something that you bomb with bombers or fighters, you have to have ground troops to occupy a country or a territory on a map when you're doing simulation. So no, I'm going to use those resources in a way that does not put my very limited Air Force in danger and that operates in support of getting troops on the ground. I think I can save more lives that way than I can by going through with this myopic strategy I'm getting from an inmate. Well, okay, Captain Whitman, I appreciate all those reasons. That's very, that's very interesting and important. But, you know, lieutenant Douglas here, sir, I know we haven't met. But what if we do this? What if we just like come up with a bunch of pistols and we air drop them into the camp? Like we like drop weaponry onto the camp and we let these people inside the camp that seem to be organized just fight themselves. What if we could do something like that or we could, I don't know Polish paratroopers or something? What do you think we could do? I mean, it's Poland, right? They would. What about one of these plans? Would that work? Okay, we'll play over. Polish paratroopers. I think there were there were there were but but individually, they're actually not not large groups of people. And where are we going to get enough of those to drop in one? These were strategies. These are noble things. I feel the same outrage you do, Captain Douglas or whatever. I'm looking at it. You randomly assigned yourself and I don't know why you didn't use your own name, but we used exactly my name. Oh, Douglas was the Sandlands were the Douglases before they came over to the New World. That's why I used that. Yeah, it was fun. So okay, I like what you did. There was actually some depth to that. I didn't expect it. There's a little expanded universe action. But I mean, that actually happened like the general motors made a bunch of pistols and I understand this is when the US was involved, but general motors made a bunch of pistols. There was a little pistol called the Liberator that was dropped on France, if I'm not mistaken. And I don't know, what was the deal with the Polish paratroopers? Amy, there was something. There was there was Polish paratroopers. There were Czech paratroopers. There were a number of individuals or small groups dropped into hostile territories for reconnaissance missions, for espionage missions. I mean, if you're familiar, if you've ever seen the movie, Anthropoid, which is about the operation to assassinate Reinhardt-Hydric, who was a really high up member, really orchestrated the final solution. He was actually assassinated near Prague, and that was done by a couple Czech resistors who were literally dropped into the nation to do it. And then there were similar cases with some Polish soldiers as well. But again, the target is one person, not a garrisoned camp. It sounds great when you're in fifth grade and you're learning about this for the first time to raise your hand and be like, Mr. Ravenshalag, I have a question. Why didn't they all just bum rush the guards and rip them from limb and then go home? Then the answer is because there were people on the other side of the walls too. That wasn't going to work. You were going right back. The prison wasn't just Auschwitz. The prison was Poland. It's the same principle as the Great Wall of China. The wall doesn't keep the Mongols out. The wall prevents the Mongols from retreating when the garrison's inland from the wall are activated by the signals on the wall, and then the Mongols are trapped against the wall. And that's where the slaughter happens. So it's a deterrent that's in multiple phases. And I think it's the same thing here. There is no convenient strategy to jump ahead in the order of operations, the Piedmoss of what we're dealing with here to jump right to liberate the concentration camps. So historically, you're mostly correct. I think you're also sadly being a little too generous to some of the allies, and I'll explain exactly why. Too generous to the allies? Well, let me explain what I mean. So first off, you're correct in that the technological ability to do so would be very difficult. At this point in the war, let's just skip to 1941-1942. The Americans are in the war. They certainly haven't breached France. D-Day is not until 1944. And the way that the troop movements are happening is you're having the Red Army move from the east, and then the allies moving first up the boot of Italy, and then eventually on the west. So you have kind of this almost pincher movement of these two groups of troops moving in. And so to be honest, it wouldn't make too much sense at this point for the allies to try to jump over the west into the east, just in terms of troop movements. But when I say- And as a quick side note there, naval support would be virtually impossible because of the pinch point provided at the Baltic Sea. You're just not running ships in there to support any kind of operation. At this point, it's just an easy place for the Germans to close off. Well, and on top of that, you consider the blitz happening in London really before the Americans joined that limits Great Britain's ability to do a massive invasion. So just technically you couldn't even get a bomber there if you wanted to. Like you can get a not and back. At this point, yes, at this point. Now, the reason why I say you're probably being a little generous is because there are some more insidious or not even insidious but unwise reasons why the British first and then the allies, the Americans didn't step in as much. First, it's because the British did not actually publicize a lot of the information that they received from the camps. Now, V told is only one person that's getting this information out. There's actually a series of reports called the Auschwitz Protocols that are coming from other individuals who have been imprisoned, who have escaped, who are aware of what's going on. And so he's not the only one getting information out. There are multiple people sending information out. So in terms of what Great Britain and the allies know, they know a lot. They know what's happening in this camp. And they have lots of confirmation to prove what's going on. But one of the reasons why they did not publish it as much, and this is a minor reason, but it's an important one, is they believed that if they publish too much about atrocities against Jews specifically, it would increase anti-Semitism at home, which sadly is not a wrong assumption because of the amount of anti-Semitism in the world at the time. I mean, we don't have to talk about it specifically what the United States did at this point, but anti-Semitism was rampant in the US State Department at this time. And it was one of the reasons why it took the Americans a long time to step in to actively participate in rescue efforts. Really, it is mind boggling to me how fashionable that brand of racism has been for so long. I don't get any kind of racism. And so there's something unique that I don't get about this. And I don't even want to speculate about it because it's gross, but I just don't get it. I don't understand what the issue is or what the gripe is. I don't understand it during the Crusades. I don't understand it even one generation after living memory of the revolts that happened a century after Jesus. There's just not stuff to point to. And yet it keeps rearing its head. And every people group has taken a turn being anti-Semites. Nobody gets to be on their high horse here. Everyone has taken their turn holding these grotesque views toward this group of people. It's bizarre when you see that crop up over, especially just even the last 150 years. Why? And it pops up in such bizarre circles. It's like sometimes you talk about strange bedfellows, and then you get strange rivalries or strange discriminations that don't make any sense to me. And just the idea that this anti-Semitism was widespread and it was everywhere and it was happening when I was a kid, I was like, that has to be exaggerated. That had to just be some kind of propaganda thing in Germany. And the more you learn, the more you realize, like, no, this is some kind of mind disease that has plagued a whole lot of people inexplicably for a really long time. Well, and to give a very, very quick history of anti-Semitism, to at least provide some context to this time, as you alluded to, there's the early theological anti-Semitism. People believe the Jews are responsible for killing Christ, and that's kind of where some of this starts. And then by the 19th century, it turns into it kind of merges with this history of scientific racism and eugenics, this belief that there were not only racial differences, but there are also value differences between different races and the belief that Jews, African Americans, the United States were somewhat less valuable because of their race. And so this history of anti-Semitism merges with that movement. And so by the time the Nazis take control of this form of racial anti-Semitism, the belief that Jews specifically were a different race and therefore an inferior race of people was sadly very popular. I mean, you see the eugenics movement in the United States kind of play into that a little bit. They also, you know, which we suddenly got very quiet about. And that was popular. It was hot in the 1920s and 30s. It was in Time magazine. People were talking about the medical benefits that could come with a eugenics based approach to medicine and thinking about race. And then Hitler started doing it. And it was like, well, did we just going to memory hold that? It's like, we try to pretend that we didn't have this phase here. And it's very unfashionable because, well, it's very unfashionable to bring up because of what groups it was fashionable amongst in our country. One and not even, you know, do we not talk about it, but and not even was it was it that bad. American eugenicists were some of the most extreme. So extreme that the Nazis actually took research from American scientists and eugenicists and implemented it in their own programs. So during this time, I mean, we'll step aside from some of the racial antisemitism for a second. There's a mass movement for forced sterilization in the United States and elsewhere among the mentally and physically disabled. And there are about 21 states in the 1920s and 30s that have sterilization laws in the United States. And then the Nazis implement a lot of that science, which of course existed in Great Britain and elsewhere, but implement that science into their T4 program, which was their euthanasia program in which they force forcibly euthanized primarily Germans actually, who who had mental and physical disabilities. And so sadly, although the Nazis take it to a completely different level, some of that research came from the United States. I'm sitting here Googling United States sterilization laws. And I'm looking, you're absolutely right. There's a list of all the laws. Thankfully, obviously, the first thing I do is run to my state, like what did they do here? And it was just a proposed bill here. But I mean, I'll leave it to other people to Google their state and figure out what happened when. But I didn't know this. This is jaw dropping at the the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. I had learned about the eugenics stuff. And also went to Nuremberg. The the the I'm sorry, I mean, what is the big Colosseum is a Reich's Colosseum or the I forget what it's called. It's a big Nazi Colosseum. I do as well. Yeah. Yeah. In Nuremberg. Yeah. In Nuremberg. Yeah. And so there's this really interesting attitude in Germany. When I was at that big Colosseum, all the students were coming through and the attitude was never again. Like we haven't we have a responsibility of having the conversation about what went down here in Germany and making sure that it doesn't happen again. Whereas you just told me something about what happened here in the US that I didn't know. And I should know this. I should know that there were, you know, the role of eugenics back in the day here, you know, because people are wrong often. Yeah. And the idea that wrong and mass. Yeah. The idea that we're right, everything, every law that's on the books right now in the place where you live third chair, wherever that is or fourth chair, whatever it is today, wherever you live, there's laws on the books. And it's it's legal to do something that doesn't make it okay. Well said that doesn't make it right morally. And that that's something we should remember, I think. And in support of that point, Destin, you asked if I'd ever been to a concentration camp earlier in our conversation. And I balked a little bit having driven by one and I'm embarrassed that I don't remember which it was. I was a much younger man when I did that a couple of day drive around Germany. But I have been to one. And I didn't know the name of it. And I even know where it is. I've been to a concentration camp in Cody, Wyoming. Hmm. Heart Mountain concentration camp was a relocation camp. Sounds better for Japanese Americans for a brief period during World War two. I can't trust those folks. You know, there are mortal enemies. And so the atrocities of Auschwitz certainly did not occur at heart mountain or Cody, Wyoming. But we arrested people for nothing, relocated them and treated them like people who were chess pieces on board. We can do what we want with them. I'm glad that some restraint was exercised. But still, the truth of the matter is the only camp of this nature I've ever actually set foot in is in my beloved home state of Wyoming. There's actually a camp in Alabama. It's called Aliceville. Aliceville, excuse me, my southern accent was coming out of Aliceville. Now, Aliceville, Alabama, there were actually Germans that were held in Alabama. You know what? I need to get in the car and just go down there and learn stuff. I need to learn what happened there. What the status of that was, like, were these prisoners held honorably? I mean, I need to understand more about history locally. Interesting. If you're going to have war, you need to have a camp for captured combatants because the two alternatives are awful. Defeat them and let them go fight more or mass slaughter, which has been the strategy at other points in history. Those are both bad ideas. And so the idea of some sort of reasonable detention and the expectation of your enemies engaging in the same sort of reasonable and humane detention until aggressions desist. I mean, that's an age-old rule of war. And so I don't like war. I'm strongly opposed. That said, if we're going to do it, having some kind of ground rules for what we do when we capture an enemy combatant and how they'll be treated is a good idea. We've seen that go wrong in the American South, in the Andersonville Prison Camp, which was an absolute nightmare. But oftentimes belligerents honor these rules of war that they make what to do with a captured combatant. And I'm sure it's not fun to be a captured combatant in any type of environment. But what we're talking about at Hart Mountain, not in any way to diminish what you're bringing up, my friend, like, that's a different deal. These weren't combatant. They're civilians, citizens, civilians, like, you just looked the wrong way. Your name was the wrong thing. Your grandparents were born in the wrong place. Yuck. I don't want part of that. I don't want that to be us. There that camp sits. This is why some of this history is so difficult for Americans to look at, because the point that you guys were making about it. Germany has had to have a massive reckoning with the Holocaust, which is why they're very big on saying never again. They went through the whole psychological process of that. The Holocaust didn't happen here, at least not the Holocaust we're talking about. Whereas in the United States, one of the things at the time that, to be honest, people had to wrestle with or try to sadly ignore was the fact that not only we were re-entering Japanese Americans, but this was the era of Jim Crow. There were African Americans going to fight for our freedom in Europe who did not have the freedom that they were fighting for in the United States. During the 1930s, there were actually African Americans who went to Germany seeking greater freedom that they had in the United States. That was in the 30s? In the 1930s, yes. Wow. Yep. That was before or after Hitler rose to power. Mostly before. So there is a very, very complicated history about how Black Germans, African Americans, anyone who was not white, was treated under the Nazis. Usually not well, the general ideas that had the Holocaust gone or had the Nazis been in power longer than things would have continued to get worse for Afro-Germans, for African Americans who were trapped in Germany at the time. But yeah, before the Holocaust, there were people escaping to Germany seeking freedom that they didn't have here in the United States. Well, there was no military benefit to an alliance with the Jews. You didn't need to keep anybody happy there for military gain. Whereas your fellow Axis power, Italy, was strongly connected in Khush or Ethiopia, as it was. In fact, the longest-standing, uninterrupted dynasty in human history was Ethiopia, interrupted by Mussolini and the Italians. And so you were conducting a pretty significant African campaign and you were going to have a tough time getting along with the locals if there was a Holocaust being carried out against Africans as well. There's again an order of operations that was being followed. So one of the things that the Nazis were not fans of was what they called racial mixing. And so there were a number of Afro-German children being born primarily in the Rhineland between black soldiers and sometimes African-American soldiers actually who were there during the First World War and German women. And so the Nazis organized this semi-underground basically sterilization program on these children because they considered people who were again quote racially mixed to be inferior, which gets me back to the T-4 program, which was their forced euthanasia program. So the euthanasia program, which actually does not begin until 1939, there's two important points about this that connect to our story. First, once information came out about what the Nazis were doing to people who were disabled, there was a huge outcry primarily among Catholics, Lutherans, Christians in Europe who were just, you know, appalled that the Nazis were forcibly killing people because of disabilities. There was such a big outcry that the Nazis actually, they didn't really disband their program, they just moved it underground. That brings up two things. First off, where that program went or where the experiments conducted within that program went, but secondly, it really makes me think about there was this huge outcry as there should have been for the T-4 program, there was not a similar outcry for what was being done to the Jews in Germany and elsewhere, which brings up a lot of very difficult things that a lot of people, but especially Christians, have to wrestle with that, you know, this is a really complicated area of history, but there really was not, I would say, an appropriate response at the time to what was happening to Jews in Germany and in wider Europe. So that's the first part of that. The second part is that the T-4 program was where the Nazis first started experimenting with gas. They started using carbon monoxide, they would actually force people into trucks, enclose the truck, put an exhaust pipe in it, and that's how they would kill large numbers of people at one time. Now, of course, the T-4 program kind of somewhat goes away, but those experiments with gas move into the concentration camps, and that is one of the things that V told Puletsky starts to see happening, especially in 1942. And so he and his fellow prisoners, first they see the crematoria built, which is basically built by prisoners in the camp, and they start to see massive train loads of Jewish prisoners arrive, not just Jewish men, but Jewish women and Jewish families arrive at the camp. And notice that, you know, these families are not in the bunks with them, they're not held anywhere in camp, and so through their observations, through the rumors traveling through the camp, they quickly find out this is where the Nazis are not only building the gas chambers, but building gas chambers and using them on a wide scale. And so they had stopped using carbon monoxide at the time, they started using Zikon B, which was a pesticide, was sadly very deadly. This is probably the right word. Very efficient at what it was. Very efficient. Yeah, I was trying to avoid the word efficient, but efficient at what they were trying to do. Can you imagine the weight of, you know, you're sitting there, you're, it's like being on a planet in a big galaxy and not being able to stand back and look at the whole galaxy and get the shape of where you're at. Can you imagine being in a camp and slowly start to understand and become more, you know, the picture becomes more clear, like, I saw a child get off that train. I haven't seen the child in the camp. Once you understand what's your close proximity to the weight and the evil and the, I do not think I understand what that revelation must have been like. That's, that's insane. I mean, it's certainly unimaginable. And it brings up a lot of questions for people inside the camp. Now, these people who are murdered in very large numbers were leaving belongings behind. And the Nazis would, you know, call through those and steal things and use them for their own, their own purposes. But there are also prisoners whose responsibility it was to unload the gas chambers after they were completed, I'll say, and, and categorize the items left behind. And there were some prisoners who, you know, would, would, if they found items of food in those belongings, they would take them. They would use things that they found to barter. And someone like V told, you know, thought about that said, no, you know, I mean, the, the horror of, you know, going through a dead person's belongings for something for your own was horrifying to him. But lots of prisoners made different choices. You know, if you have a piece of food and you're hungry, you know, what are you going to do? So it brought up lots of very difficult choices or difficult decisions that prisoners had to make, but make, but like you were saying, just the weight of that is really important because it connects to something we've talked about already is the, it's almost hard to imagine what was going on in these camps. And so as you can possibly imagine people hearing about this from the outside in newspapers and radio could not understand the sheer magnitude of what was going on. You know, there were, there were a couple prisoners around the same time. I think a little later, actually, who escaped and wrote most of what we call the Auschwitz protocols, which, you know, revealed a lot of what was going on. And no one said that they were lying, but there were a lot of people who just could not wrap their heads around it, who just did not want to believe what was going on. Because I mean, why would you want to believe that? You know, it's inconvenient. It's inconvenient because to, I feel this in my own heart, if there's a truth that seems to be very, very evil, if I'm confronted with that truth, I'm, I don't know, I'm compelled to action. And action is difficult. So it's easier for me to dismiss the information than it is to actually wrestle with the question in my head of what to do with the information. I can see how a person could get there. And I think there are parallels with the conversation we had earlier about what may or may not be happening in China. Mm hmm. Yeah. It's like, what do you say? Again, it's hard to imagine. But imagine we were us, and it was 1942. And we heard this. What are we going to do? I mean, and there's a whole different discussion we could have about how people responded, the rallies, the, you know, boycotting German goods. There were lots of things that people did, but as an individual, it's like, it's almost easier to just shut your eyes than realize that you are powerless against something this massive. Yes. It's just hard to comprehend. My eyes twitching. My eyes twitching with this car. My eye doesn't twitch, but this is, you know, I mean, this is probably not fun to listen to. No. Yeah, it's not fun for me to listen to. So, but, but I think it's important to, to understand that the world is not what we want it to be sometimes. And I don't know. My eyes twitching. And I'm just sitting here looking pissed off into the zoom call for the last twenty, making frowny faces and ripping apart this SD card adapter and putting it back together. Same thing. You cannot talk about this stuff without a physical reaction. And I want to interrupt you both every five seconds to pound the pulpit that much more about the outrage, but also about human frailty and all of the meta narrative that exists here. This is the story about one thing, but this is also demonstrative of the depths of human depravity, human stupidity, human willingness, as Destin just mentioned, to out of experience and personal convenience, only think things to be true that work for us and that allow our psyche to hold together. And I mean, we, when I say all of this, I don't mean everybody else except me because I get how the things are. I have the luxury of being raised in a certain moment in time, when we had absolute moral clarity on issues like this, we had just learned a horrible, expensive lesson. And I don't for a second believe that somehow Germany was more predisposed to this than somebody else. Remember, we had these things cooking here and so did the rest of the West. We were very into the ideology that ended up undergirding Nazi thought. I think the Nazis got to the front of the line because they felt jilted by World War one. They felt jilted by colonialism. You go around the world, you look at Latin America, Africa, South America, nobody speaks German. There aren't a bunch of German islands in the Caribbean, just little pockets here and there. I mean, Germany tried to get hooks into Mexico. The same time everybody else was trying to get hooks into Mexico and Latin America. And they just lost. They just misplayed their hand. They had a little bit of pressure from the East during those centuries. And any other century colonialism happens, Germany gets to be in the driver's seat of all of that. So Germany looks at it and they're like, what the heck? Like you catch us on like a down few decades, you divide up the whole world, we don't get to participate. I think it's a series of fluke luck of the draw moments, culturally and historically that puts Germany in this edgy place of being like, hey, we are, we're one of the big players here. And it doesn't look like it right now globally, but we are. And that got into the blood, it got into the psyche for a little bit. It affected moral judgment because nationalism and shared pride will do that. And I don't say that to say, look how dumb and bad the Germans are. I say all of that to say, all of those things could have sifted out differently and the already negative legacy of colonialism could have sifted out differently. Somebody else could have got dealt out and tried to overcompensate. A few battles could have gone a different way here or there. And somebody else could have been the one that finally got to a place of engaging in this scale of atrocity. And then they would be the bad guys of that decade that we're talking about. But the reality is we had some serious moral problems that everybody in the West was cruising toward when this went down. And Germany got down the road faster. But I don't want my surly tone of moral indignation and outrage and emotion that you're getting from me through all of this to be like, and the point is Germans are bad. The point is, humans are bad. The point is we are a mess. And we have capacity for such darkness that we would like to imagine is only present in the bad guys in our comic books and our space opera movies that we like to watch. But it's in us. And the reason a good bad guy resonates with us is because we see little elements of Darth Vader and Thanos and Sauron in our own soul. We see it in the mirror in that last bit of the reflection. And we see it in the Nazis, the most deplorable thing that we can imagine that humans have cooked up. We see a dash of some stuff that we're made of there too. And so it's like they say, you know, if you're really angry at somebody or something, it's because you see a little bit of yourself in there. If you're angry at Nazis, hopefully part of why you're angry and part of something that'll serve on a check against your own darker impulses that you see a tiny little dash of your own capacity for utter abject selfish wickedness in what they did. I think there's an interesting metaphor here. And I'm gonna screw it up. But as you were talking, I was realizing that you're right. All that stuff exists in my own heart. And in order to confront that, I would like to say, oh, it can be an inside job. I could go confront all that. But there has to be that element of what did you say? Amy, what was the quote from Lord of the Rings, right out to meet it or whatever? Right out to meet them. Right out to meet them. There has to be a level of willingness to confront the evil that's within your own soul. And sometimes it can't happen. You don't understand the own internal evil that exists. Sometimes you have to have that external, that external measurement of your own. It's sin. I'm just gonna say the word sin. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I am so glad we're talking about this because this is important, but it also underlines the importance of talking about history like this. Because as someone in my place who not only has studied this type of history for a long time, but it has two degrees in this type of history, learning about the Holocaust broke me. And I had to figure out ways to put myself back together. Because as humans, we tell ourselves stories about ourselves. And we have this egocentric bias that when we learn about the Nazis or we learn about bad things in history, we think, well, that was bad, but I'm a generally good person. You know, I wouldn't do something like that. But then when you really dive into things like this, what you realize, and this is the realization that just broke me, was that as you guys were saying, humans are capable of great good, but all of us are capable of great evil if you put us in certain situations. And what we're seeing here is the Nazis were in many ways, uniquely evil, but in many ways, they were not. I mean, the people who perpetrated these crimes were they weren't born evil. They weren't, you know, there was nothing unique about them. They were people. You could argue that you could argue that. We're all born evil. We're all born evil. I'm kind of in the total depravity. We're all born good. And then we get worse later. The Holocaust doesn't have the Holocaust as a reflection of how we pop out. You know what I'm saying, though, people were not born Nazi. I do. I just, I was just, I hear you. I was putting a pen in total depravity. Anyway, go ahead. But to my point, I'm glad you brought this up because in Germany at the time, and elsewhere, I mean, we talk about us now, but in Germany, Germany was a center of culture before World War I. I mean, it was academia was really strong. I mean, basically, the study of history was created in Germany during the night. The British monarchy at the time was born out of Germany. Absolutely. And so there was almost this, just like there was elsewhere, this cultural arrogance at the time of we've moved past this kind of thing. You know, if you would have talked to anyone at the time and you would have asked them, I mean, this is very counterfactual, but if you would have asked them, where would you expect the most anti-Semitism, everyone would have said France. They would have obviously said France. You know, there's the, the German writer Thomas Mann, he was watching the, the Dreyfus affair happen in the late 19th century, which was this, you know, we don't have to go into all the details, but this terrible anti-Semitic court case where this Jewish man was put on trial for espionage and basically convicted because he was Jewish. And it was this horrible, horrible case. And so Thomas Mann is looking at that from Germany saying, this is horrible. I am so glad that nothing like this could happen in Germany. That happened. And then it happens. And then it happens. And so it's so important to understand that, you know, I mean, we say never again, there's, there's a very specific meaning to that. You know, the Holocaust did not start with the gas chambers. The Holocaust started with the exclusion and legal oppression of certain groups. And it just grew because there's this whole question that we've kind of stumbled around of what if people would have done more? What if, what if what if what if, what if, what if the United States had implemented a refugee program before January of 1944? What would happen? No granted, troops couldn't march their way into Poland, the second they wanted to, there were limitations to it. But in the United States, for example, at the time, we had very oppressive immigration laws and quotas. The point where actually, I'm glad we're talking about this because we're reaching the anniversary of it. This is a tangent, but it, it exemplifies my point. There was a ship called the MS St. Louis. I'm not sure if you're familiar with this ship, but it was a German cruise liner that left Germany, Germany in May 1938. With about a thousand Jewish passengers on board, all of whom had already been vetted to come into the United States. They were just waiting for their number to come up because of the quota system. Yeah, this is a very famous case. So they, they were going to Cuba where they could wait until they came into the United States. Now, when they get to Cuba, long story short, there was some government corruption in Cuba and they were not allowed in. And so what happens is this cruise liner, in Cuba, yeah, surprise, surprise, but it gets worse. So this cruise liner cruises up the coast of the United States because if you know about, I mean, we all know about geography, but for people listening, Cuba is very close to Florida. They're right there, close to the United States. And so people on board are sending wires and telegrams to anyone that they can think of in the United States begging to be allowed in. And so the White House gets a bunch of requests. The mayor of St. Louis, Missouri gets a request because of the name of the ship. And the awful part of all of that is that all of those requests were ignored. The United States does not allow that ship in. It ends up being sent back to Europe. The captain of the ship makes a deal with three or four nations. It's Great Britain, France, Belgium, and I think Norway are the four who take in groups of passengers from the ship because the passengers refuse to go back to Germany. Outright refused. And so, as we know, if you know anything about the Second World War, Great Britain is the only one of those countries that was not directly invaded by the Nazis. Now, they were bombed, but they were not invaded. And so about a third of the prisoners on that ship died in the Holocaust, despite the fact that they were so close to the United States. And so there's so much to wrestle with as Americans about how we responded or did not respond to the Holocaust. This was someone like V told Puletsky and others are getting information about this out. By November of 1942, the world knew. There was a press conference in the United States, FDR responded to it. The world knew that the Nazis had a plan to quote exterminate the Jewish population of Europe. Yeah, it's one of those myths you get in history class that we walked into concentration camps and were like, what? Yeah, that's that's who knew. That's the way it was kind of taught to me. Yeah. So there's there's two different competing myths there. There's the myth that we didn't know anything, which is a myth we definitely knew. But there's also the myth that the United States ran, you know, went into World War II because we were going to liberate concentration camps and blah, blah, blah, blah. So a lot of liberators, people we call liberators, people who entered concentration camps and freed prisoners do not like being called liberators because although the higher ups in the military knew about what was happening because of, you know, all this information that had been transmitted, your average soldier, you know, might have heard some things, but if they've been in Europe for three years, they're not necessarily going to know what's going on. They felt like they just happened upon these camps. And even for people like, we're going off on a tangent, but this is an important tangent. General Eisenhower, who had a pretty good idea, of course, he becomes president. And Eisenhower, General Eisenhower is a pretty good idea of what he was coming up on when he and his troops were about to liberate a satellite camp of Buchenwald in Germany. Not only does he require the troops to tour the camp and to document what he's they had seen, but he sends a telegram to Marshall right after this. And he says, and I'm paraphrasing a little bit, but he said, I felt it very important for me to be a witness to these things that I could not describe because there may become a day when people call this propaganda and say that it didn't happen. And so a big reason why we know about these things is because people like an Eisenhower and earlier on, people like V told Blesky made the decision to document them. And so we'll kind of get to the end of V told story, but just the fact that he was transmitting this information is important, not just for the time that he was in, but for us historically, so that we know what was going on in those camps so that when we say never again, we actually know what that means. My pastor Steve, he said something amazing the other day. He said, there are ways to know things. One tool you might use is the scientific method. And in the scientific method, you can know x, y, z by repeating an experiment and observing it to be true over and over and over again. He said, but there are certain things that are unknowable. And most of those things fall within the realm of history. For example, did Washington cross the Delaware for the Battle of Trenton? And the answer is yes. And the question is, how do you know that? Steve does a great job. We should have him on some time, Matt, just to explain the difference in the scientific method and the historical method, he would teach both of us a lot. But that's the epistemology episode. That'd be great. But getting to your point, I understand what you mean because of his lesson to me. And if it wasn't for someone who documented this in a very accurate, very specific way, we wouldn't be able to point to it and say, this is true because because the historical method is very different than the scientific method. You have to understand context, you have to understand all that stuff. So what is the report that Puletsky wrote? He wrote a report when he got out? What was the name of it? Yeah, so he wrote a few reports. I mean, there were kind of individual pieces of information he got out. So he, you know, going back to kind of the top of what you talked about, he's realizing in 1943 that, you know, this camp has not been bombed yet. I don't know, you know, he doesn't feel like his information is going through. And so he decides, all right, I got to escape myself. And so he and two other prisoners escape in 1943. And he ends up making his way back to Warsaw, making his way back to the underground. And he, he writes this 100 page report on camp life, which he of course transmits through the courier service and it gets to the right people. But around this time, I mean, this is 1943 and he becomes re-involved in the underground in Poland. And so that information is out there. I mean, by 1943, granted, if you were a small town Kansas, like my family was, you might not have all the information that we have historically, but by 1943, this information was printed in newspapers because of things like, like people like Vittold Puletsky and the fact that American bombers actually flew over Auschwitz and took pictures. So we actually have pictures of what was, what was going on. So the information is out there. Meanwhile, he is participating in the underground. He gets himself involved in the October 1944 Warsaw uprising that is different than the Warsaw ghetto uprising, which was in 1943. But the Warsaw uprising was just like the whole city rising up against Nazi oppression. And he gets himself arrested during that by communists in Poland at the time because in 1944. And 1945. Amy Quick sidebar. Yes. The craziest thing about this conversation and the emotion that it stirs in me is only half of the equation because we're not even going to get to Stalin communist Russia. No, we're not even going to get to the Soviets. Deal with the hell that you had to make because we're not winning that war without the Soviets. But oh my goodness, let no complaining about Nazism in any way create some kind of smokescreen where we don't acknowledge the absolute ethical dumpster fire that was going on on the other side on the other front as well. I'll shut up again. Please continue. No, this is important because, okay, so there's a couple stages here. So he participates to the uprising. He actually gets himself arrested. I believe by Germans for a while, spends the rest of the war in a prisoner of war camp is freed. And he goes and joins the free Polish troops in Italy in 1945 and ends up being caught by communists. At some point, I'm kind of unclear on how that happened, but he gets arrested by Polish communist leaders in 1945 because the Soviet Union just rushes into Eastern Europe. And as we know, it becomes the Cold War and the Iron Curtain. And we don't have to go into all of that. But to your point, which is very important, and this is a very tricky thing to talk about historically, but people who were liberated from Nazi oppression, from concentration camps, it was great. I mean, to be liberated from that was very important. But it didn't mean that the situation they found themselves in afterwards was all sunshine and roses. So one of my areas of study is the Holocaust in Hungary. And the Red Army comes into Hungary and the beginning of the battle actually starts on Christmas Eve of 1944. And then it's about a two month battle until they retake the entire city. And what happens when the Red Army comes in is they sure they push out the Germans, sure they liberate the city, but they start pillaging the city, molesting women, stealing from people who had previously been under under occupation. And so it's great that the Germans are gone. It's great that they're liberated, but it doesn't mean that things are all great once the Red Army shows up. And so that's obviously very true in Poland as well. Puletsky gets himself involved in kind of the underground anti-communist movement very briefly until he is arrested within a couple years of the war ending. I like this guy. I mean, it's just like how I mean, I have all these questions, but how does someone even do this? But like one dude fought Stalin communist and the Nazis. The Nazis. Exactly. Oh my goodness. Exactly. Yeah, there are no amount of medals. Well, well, speaking of medals, he was given this is how I first learned about about Puletsky is I had heard that he was given the Order of the White Eagle, which is my understanding is like the highest award that Poland can give. And Puletsky got that. Now, do you know what year he got that in? I don't know. You know what? I'm not going to tell you because I'll tell you at the end of the story. That's an important part of the story. No, it's important. The narrative is important here. Okay. So he gets himself arrested a couple years after the war ends by communists and he's put in this show trial where he's not allowed to actually testify. There's no defending witnesses. I mean, it's a real Soviet show trial like kangaroo court type situation. Like he had no no option of defending himself. And then in May of 1948, he has executed because he's found guilty in this show trial executed by communists. Now, the reason why I want to talk about the year is that do we know how he was executed? He was shot in that. Okay. Okay. Very quickly. So in the case of Puletsky, and to be honest, a lot of other resistors and a lot of other rescuers, his story is basically buried. People don't really know what he did until after 1989, when the wall falls and when information starts coming out of the former Soviet Union, because he was he was killed by communists. So they're not going to be parading that information around. And so he dies believing that his mission had failed. Oh my goodness. Yeah, really. And then decades and decades and decades pass. And no one knows who this guy is. I mean, people who directly interact with him, sure had some idea, but the world does not know who he is. And so the reason why I didn't want to tell you yet was because he gets the order of the white eagle in 2006. What decades and decades and decades after he died. So he goes unrecognized for years and years. And like I said, that is true of a lot of resistance efforts because a lot of resistors either died or in many cases, just kind of went home and didn't tell anyone. And the information doesn't come out until years and years later, which is why this stories like this are so important because he's long gone. The only thing that we can do is share this story and think about what we can learn from a story like this. I had an emotional response to that. I had chills Matt when you were telling me to write the whole idea of fighting for what is right. And then when you told me that he died thinking he had failed, but he had done so much that was that didn't cry. But eyes watered. I felt very strong emotions when he said that. That's amazing. Can you imagine being anyone in Poland to receive the order of the white eagle after that? That's what that means. Good grief. We could go on and on about this, but it's and this is a whole other podcast episode. But the man responsible for the largest civilian rescue mission of the entire Holocaust was a man by the name of Carl Lutz who rescued tens of thousands of people. He also died thinking that he had been unrecognized. Dye is like not not being recognized. And this is so true of a lot of different people. I mean, if you've seen that very famous like YouTube video of this this German man who participated at the Kindertransport saved a bunch of children. He might have been British saved a bunch of children during the Holocaust and he's sitting in an audience and someone on stage says, hey, have you been if anyone in this room was rescued by this man, please stand up and the entire audience stands up because they were children who he had rescued. That guy just didn't tell anyone. He just went home and didn't tell you when what he had done until he tells like his grandchildren. And so there are people like V told and Lutz who died before they're recognized, but there are also people who just believed that what they did was what any normal human would do. So I mean, we talked about before we got on the air, you know, going to Israel at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Israel, they have something they recognize people that they call righteous among the nations, people who are typically non Jewish who helped Jews during the Holocaust through no and got no sort of material or financial benefit for it. And if you go, Lutz got that award. He did Lutz got that award and his wife got that award in the 1950s and 1960s. And if you actually sit down and read accounts by people like that, by resistors, by rescuers, they always say the same thing. They say, you know what? I was just doing what any good person would do. Or someone like Lutz said, I thought it was just a matter of conscience. I mean, these are not people who are thinking, I'm doing something so great. I'm a great person. They're mostly shocked that other people are not doing it, which just is right. That's what I was going to say is that statement is so damning toward millions upon millions upon millions of others. No, Mr. Lutz, you are sadly and sorely mistaken. That is not what any normal person would do. It is what a normal person would boast about from the comfort of his basement where he records a podcast and utter safety in the middle of the United States moments before he goes outside to grill hot dogs on the patio grill. Yeah, easy for me to say, easy for me to thump my chest and talk about how brave I am and how morally outraged I am. I'm not a coward. I've just never been tested and that guy got tested and he passed with flying colors. I don't know. I don't know either. I want to sit here and say like, Oh, well, he had the order of the white eagle in mind when he started by going into the concentration camp. I don't think he was thinking that big. No, I think he was thinking more along the lines of all hell. No, you know, no, you ain't doing that in my Poland. You're not going to do that to these Jewish people. Two things I want to say. Number one, I find it interesting that he was a Christian and he was fighting for the rights of the Jewish people in the area. And I'm not saying there's anything special about Christians in that regard. I've seen this happen many different ways and many, you know, across many different lines. But I do think it's very interesting that he's fighting for the rights of another quote people group. That stands out to me. Another thing is there's this book that was written. I don't remember the name of the book or anything, but I found this quote over and over when I was reading about Pulitsky and it's the rabbi Michael Schudrich. He was the chief rabbi of Poland, wrote the forward for this book. And this is what he said, when God created the human being, God had in mind that we should all be like captain with V told Pulitsky of blessed memory. May the life of V told Pulitsky and Spirus all to do one more good deed of any kind each and every day of our lives. I thought that was a really good quote. It's great and it reflects his life. You know, and he was well, we won't have to dwell on it. But when he was in those camp, it was just every day one more good deed helping one person helping, you know, finding more food for another person. And that's that's how we did it one day at a time. Selflessness. How do you want to land the plane here? I mean, it's hard to land the plane here with questions like this because I I'm sitting here thinking, I think the same thing as you all are thinking is what does this mean for us? What is learning a story like this? What do people listening to this? You know, what do you do now? You know, when you when you hear about something like this, I just think it's so important to learn stories about people like Pulitsky because it's it begins the process or continues the process for some of us of doing that self reflection of doing a self analysis of asking yourself what what would I have done? And and I think as I mentioned earlier, a lot of us come to the point of of saying, I don't know, I might have stood to the side. I might have not have done anything. And it it really for me ends up being a moral imperative to not only tell stories like this, but to sit down and think about how I can become the type of person who would have done something like V told Pulitsky did. I think there's tremendous value in the details of those of those stories. Because it's one thing for all of us to say, man, I would sure never want to help unload a bunch of Jewish people off of a box car and then gas them to death. How morally difficult is it to say that? Hopefully everybody would say that pretty easily. But that's not a very sophisticated take because this didn't happen because one day a bunch of German 20 year old boys woke up and we're like, you know what we should do is we should just gas a ton of Jewish people to death. Let's just do it. That's not how this happened. This wasn't a roving gang. This wasn't a silly idea that happened on a bet between a bunch of teenagers who had too much time on their hands. This was a complex escalation. It was a trillion to the trillionth power, little amoral decisions that people made that people gave a pass to in themselves and in others. It was a billion little concessions that got made in the minds of people and families. It was a billion little lesser of two evil choices that people made when they voted. It was a billion little unsatisfied slights and little moments of pride that people let take root over time. In other words, it was simply an exponentially large version of things that I allow to happen in my brain and my heart when I scroll Twitter, when I hear from people whose ideas I don't like very much, when I come up with my strategy for how to vote in the next clumsy silly election. It's the same stuff that confronts me and none of us are going to pass this test by any merit of our own effort or energy. There's some kind of or I should put it this way. None of us are going to pass that test lazily or by default. A deep dive into understanding not just that we have problems and struggle with depravity, but how? Why? What does it look like? How does it escalate? What did a good person, good person in quotes who looks just like me? Same age, same upbringing, same style, same socioeconomic status. But in the 1930s in Germany, how did that guy go along with this? That's what someone like me needs to know. How did that get unpacked? And so every one of these little stories is beneficial in that it helps to paint a more complete picture of how it happened. It's really easy and lazy and not morally courageous for me to say, never again. Well, doesn't that sound noble? What's difficult is to do the hard work of understanding why? And then to figure out how to articulate something that is incredibly hot button and delicate in regards to this topic to say, maybe again, careful, like, I need to tread lightly. I need to tread lightly and how I think about that person and that person and that group and about myself and about my ideology and about political expedience and about careless casual wishes for violence or some sort of ill fate for somebody who I think has bad ideas or is dangerous. If I want to check the billion little decisions that a whole bunch of people made that got them to this point back in the day, I've got to become a lot more conscious of the billion little decisions that I'm faced with and make them differently than whatever got the people who came before us to the place they got to when they did this. So I need people because I'm not morally sufficient or intelligent or developed enough on my own without a cautionary tale. I need people like this to come along and tell these stories that reach across the decades so that I can see the anatomy of what went wrong in the heart of a people and of individuals and then try to guard myself against making the exact same mistake because I made it the exact same stuff as the people who made this mistake in the first place. So for me, the very passionately held value that I assigned to what you have graced us with with this great conversation, Amy, is it holds up a mirror to my soul and it's all data that I need to add into the moral equation that I'm running and it helps to understand it in more detail and I understand it better than I ever understood it. And so I'll try to do things that are responsible and good and redemptive with the information. That's the way I can honor somebody who gave up so much to get the word out. Absolutely. Thank you very much, Amy. Thank you. When I asked you to teach me about V told Puletsky, I had no idea that it would be this good. So I'm grateful. But this was you, Amy Lutz, is the guardian of memories. I think it's only appropriate that you get the last word in this. Go ahead. What do you want? You know what, how I actually wanted to end it, I was looking up this on my phone as you were talking. There's a great quote from George Elliot that is the title of the movie A Hidden Life in which she says, for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life and rushed in unvisited tombs. Which is to Matt's point about how much of the good in the world is made in those little moments.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.120000000000001, "text": " This is the
