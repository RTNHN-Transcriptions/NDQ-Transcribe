Yes, I've noticed you make a lot of things on the internet. Another thing I've noticed is every time you make something on the internet, people have a tendency to write comments about the things you make. I again, I've noticed the same thing about much of your content. This idea was your suggestion, this topic. And I think it's genius. And it's it's comments on the internet, like who is making the comments and like, what's the motivation? Like who are the people doing this? And I think it's a genius topic that I'd love to talk about. Thanks. Yeah. And I'm curious to think about how it affects us and what it says about us. And yeah, I want to sociologize it a little bit. We have a buddy right now that is dealing with this. I would say in a much more powerful way than we are. Yes. Yeah, he is. So his name is Barnaby Dixon and Barnaby did a really interesting thing. Um, he makes amazing videos involving puppets and we'll talk more about that later, but Barnaby made a video about a controversial topic. I've got to say this about myself. I try to avoid controversial topics on the internet. If there's something that's intentionally divisive, I say intentionally, because a lot of people have motivations to make certain topics divisive. If I view a topic like that, I avoid it because I'm like, you know, I just don't, I just don't want to divide people, but Barnaby waited out into it. Didn't he boy? Did he? Yeah, it is a tricky topic that he chose to tackle. And he surely had to know that the comment section was going to be fascinating and that the comment section would involve some pretty serious heat and some pretty serious pushback given the topic that he chose to address and the way he chose to address it. Well, what's so interesting? I'm going to push back on you a little bit because I don't think he actually addresses the topic. He just invites another person to the table that has a differing opinion than what I would call the mainstream opinion. Yes. You know what? That's a very fair re-characterization. Your description is the superior of the two. But yeah, I like the idea of having Barnaby jump on because rather than you and me trying to recall comment storms that we've had from years past, we've got a mutual friend here who's going through it right now and it's fresh and it's raw and he'll no doubt have very honest thoughts on the thing. Yeah. Yeah. So should we just get him on? Let's do it. Barnaby's here, Matt. This is, I mean, you watched this video. Very interesting. Like, how do we how do we want to do this? Well, first of all, hi, Barnaby. It's good to see you again, man. And we said, hey, in person and an event and shot back and forth a couple of times on the internet sense. And that's right. Well, first of all, just for people who don't totally know, your talent level is one off the charts and two ridiculously weird that I had the human bent to the genre for me. I didn't know that there was hand puppet design and execution, like as an artistic category. And that's been that's been very eye opening and very fun. And I've got to see you do that in person. And for people who aren't familiar with your work, it's just going to sound head scratching weird until you go and see it. It what it does, though, that I think is brilliant. Like when I first met you and we were sent to the table with a whole bunch of other internet people and you pull out this little bird and you cram your fingers into its legs and its head and you announce it as a name, stab check. I'm like, Oh, well, that name sticks with me. I like him immediately. And this is going to sound mean, dude. I'm going to ask for, I'm going to ask for your grace in advance. But I was like, Oh no, this is like when somebody's like, I've got a joke. And everybody gets uncomfortable because they're like, I have to act like this is good. And I thought, Oh no, he's doing puppet stuff. This is like miming. Oh, okay. I need to act like this is good. And then it was incredible. And no, I was fired and I was immediately humbled by how just amazingly inventive the whole thing was. But then I didn't even understand the tip of the iceberg of what you were doing. Dab chick takes on a different personality than you and he can say stuff and do stuff that you can't do. And this happened right in front of my eyes at a table, like a holiday in, in a lobby one time. And I just remember thinking, this is genius. It's one dude giving himself multiple voices through this incredibly disarming artistic process that you can't help but marvel at in terms of sheer execution quality. And then I start watching your videos. And then I start watching more of your recent videos and you take these beautifully designed, beautifully prepared, just articulating puppets. I don't even know how to describe a Barnaby. I'm so sorry. And you give each of them a different voice that I assume is your voice doing voices and they have a different personality. They have a different character. They have a different set of gripes. They have a different read on the world. They have different proclivities, different responses to disagreement and engagement. And it lets you tackle things. It lets you have a conversation with yourself and with other people that the rest of us haven't figured out how to have yet on the internet. And so I cannot vouch hard enough for you and your brain and your artistry and what you're doing. It is so clever and so different. And if anybody in the third chair has not checked out Barnaby's stuff, it turned this garbage off and just go see that real quick and then come back because it is top notch. That said, the conversation we want to have today is about you taking one of those puppets that you designed a philosopher. Does he have a first name? Yeah, he's called Phil. Phil philosopher. I see what you're doing there. It gets literally a fish puppet, a blue fish puppet in a fishbowl. And I'm like, oh, this will probably be some cute jokes. And I start watching and the philosopher wants to have a conversation with a therapist about children transitioning, like transgender children. And I'm going, the juxtaposition is melting my brain. There's a fish puppet and a fake fishbowl with this goofy chill European accent, having a conversation with this therapist over Zoom talking about something that you can't talk about. And I was blown away by it and I went, my emotions were this. Well, this is amazing. Ooh, that really makes me think, oh, poor Barnaby, I bet he gets murdered in these comments. And I think the reason that we wanted to bring you along was not to settle once and for all the hot button issues surrounding transgenderism, gendered dysphoria, all of the questions that go on there. But we don't know what we're talking about. Who am I kidding? But more so, I wanted to talk about that interesting way that you got into the conversation and what your experiences was like with the commenting public coming out of that. So thank you for indulging me the long gushing introduction. But would you mind speaking to that? Like, what was the feedback like on that video? It was mixed in truth. At the beginning, I think it was extremely negative in terms of people getting quite upset. I think later on, those, those comments kind of settled a little bit lower down the comments section. So I think even if you watch it now, you'll see a lot of reasonable comments at the top. But when you get to a certain level, they are quite angry. Twitter was the place where I think most of the anger happened, which might not be too much of a surprise to a lot of people. But I knew it was going to be a difficult subject, but I felt very well equipped. I mean, I'm not saying what my opinion is on the subject. And I don't really know to be to be honest, but I have the sense that exploring it from a certain direction is seen as taboo. And and I think that's a problem, really, because you want to have people who have good intentions, as I believe my guest does, talking about these subjects, because she's so clearly, in my mind, coming from a place of compassion. And one of the main criticisms that I was getting even, but she was certainly getting was that her position was coming from a place of hate. And that's quite an assumption, really, when you think about it. I mean, on the one hand, you know, the activists or the detractors, whatever you want to call them, feel they have science on their side. Yet they can magically know someone's intentions. It's quite quite the juxtaposition in a lot of ways, but you do get the sense, really, that they just don't like the opinion and they're throwing whatever they can your way and seeing what sticks. Yeah, it's sometimes insults are the last resort of someone who doesn't have an argument. And I saw a lot of insults in your comments section. And did that stick to you? Like, did those affect you personally? It's hard to say they did nothing, but they probably did nearly nothing, actually, because I knew it was going to happen. I do feel sorry for people who, who kind of internet hate comes their way. And they're not quite sure what they've done wrong, because in the moment, they're kind of scrambling. And I think you get a lot of those kind of knee-jerk apologies in that moment. And then maybe they have a second more to think about it. And they think, maybe I should not have apologized for that kind of thing. But I knew I worked on this video for months in advance. I did a lot of research just so that I could, you know, so that if someone called me ignorant, that wouldn't stick. And I did a lot of, I guess it would be kind of motivational and analysis on myself, because it's one thing to be maybe you write about something, although, you know, as I say, I don't take a stance on it. It's another thing to do something for the right reasons. And I think that's important because as I say, they kind of come after your motivations. So if you are sure in your own motivations, there's very little they can do to upset you really. So what was the intent of the video? Like, why did you decide you wanted to create it? I think because what I do, as Matt was saying, I have a multitude of characters and they're quite different to the point that no one could say that it is me, really. They might infer it or they might guess, but they can't prove it. You know, I would say, for sure, I put a part of myself in the characters, but if they ever said opinion and dabjix has such ridiculous stuff, this character, that I might think, but I would never say, I might think I obviously have to think of it because I write the thing. But when it comes to Phil, he's very measured for one, but also he's a fictional character. I voice him, I puppeteer him. But for people to infer my motivations behind it, it's a little bit harder when I'm not even on the video myself. Can you introduce me to Phil? Like, well, I guess if I were to want to say, hello, Phil, how are you doing? Well, Phil's voice comes a little doesn't come so naturally to me because I've been doing it for so long. I'll give it a go though. So Phil has a kind of Eastern European sounding. At the beginning, I thought he was going to be Polish or something because his second name is Rebecca Evitt. I lived in Poland for a little while and the Reba means fish. So on the Reba Kiavitch is like fish, man, or something like this. It's amazing. It's so it's so it's so warm and inviting and calming. That was enchanted by the fish voice the whole time. And for me, it was disarming. I mean, I couldn't be mad. Do you guys ever watch those red letter media reviews of the old Star Wars films? They did reviews of the episodes one, two and three. They're like 90 minute reviews. I've never watched the entire reviews, but I know the red letter media hasn't a huge following. Yeah, a huge loyal following. I mean, they're good at film. They're good at story. And one of the things they've figured out is that the role of the critic is a it's a lame role. It's one that should be mocked because it takes a lot of energy to make something beautiful and not a lot of energy to crap on it. I mean, it's the the Brandyleany BSA symmetry principle in motion. And so what they did is they created a fictional character to do their movie critiquing for them, an old man named Mr. Plankett, who Josh compliance about everything. And I mean, he's murderous and vile and disgusting and unlovable in every imaginable way, but it positions him to be able to make the critique instead of Mike and Jay, the people who actually make the show. It had never occurred to me that this might be a way to do social criticism, literary film criticism, or even just to offer difficult opinions or get people into a conversation that might be somewhat off limits at a given time. Now they do it in a way that's crass and fumbling and I think very, very funny. But seeing you do it with such elegance, I kind of wondered as I scroll down, I thought, well, maybe this disarmed the whole thing. And maybe it's the kind of thing where like, look, I'm not going to go on the internet and yell at a fake puppet fish with an Eastern European accent. I'm just, I have my lines. I'm not yelling at a puppet fish. But no, no, those lines did not exist. Some, some people were cool with yelling at a puppet fish. What was the most clever thing that somebody yelled at you? Uh, oh, there were some really good ones, actually. So one of them, one of them, one of them said, uh, Barnaby Dickson forgot how puppets work and accidentally got stuck, stuck up his own back. That's pretty good. Oh, and another one was, um, oh, I never knew I needed to know the answer to the question. What if Jim Henson was a bigot? That's pretty mean, but quite funny too. I like the creative ones, actually. But the whole, the whole process of using a puppet to, yeah, I'm not going to say that you're using the puppet to tackle the topic. You're using the puppet to bring someone else into the conversation is the way I would, that's what it appears that you're doing. To me, it reminds me of a matador. Like a matador has this red cape and you've got the bull charging at the cape. And then you just kind of move the cape out of the way. It's almost like the puppet is your cape. And in this metaphor, the bull would be the, you know, the angry people on the internet. And you know, the thing about a matador is they look so graceful when they're out there doing their craft. And, and that's the impression I get because I mean, I saw what you did. Like at the end of the video, you had me have an authentic, uh, connection with your guests. You know, she showed us a dance. And I mean, it was amazing the way you did it. And right when the topic got really, really difficult and I was like really thinking hard, the fish would do something silly. You know, I don't even know what it would do. And it would, you know, burp a bubble or something. And I was like, whoa, this is like, this is elegant and, and how graceful you're handling this topic. And so, I mean, hats off to you, man, this is incredible, what you've done. And what inspired you to do this? Like, where did you come up with the idea in general? Or is it just something that you had to just pop in? I'll backtrack over so slightly because what you mentioned there, yes, I had, well, I asked Sasha if she would do a dance simply at the end of it and she knows what's the word. Um, it's called Oriental and Egyptian folklore dance. That's what she does. But she has this type of dance called Sayidi. And it's very interesting, I think, to lean into the talents of the guests that you have, especially if they're creative or artistic or something like that. Um, the prior guest, we had Martin Mullin, who I met at your place, actually, in Alabama when we did Thinkakon and we had him play his, um, vibraphone too. And I just feel that so much, I mean, not in the case of Martin, but when it comes to a controversial topic, it's very good to remind people that the guest is a human, you know, and something like something that's created, something that's graceful, something that's expressive, I think, especially right at the end of the video, it's sort of a message to say, okay, you're dealing with a person here, please sort of think of them that way. Don't forget that's what they are. Um, the last part of your question, would you mind repeating it? Oh, I was just wondering if the whole idea of using the puppet as a tool is something that happened because you had a puppet laying around. Like if, if only the only tool you have is a hammer, everything's a nail. Like did you have the puppet and then stumble upon this method? Or was it part of the process from the beginning? I think I can't remember exactly what what came first, the concept or the or the fish. I think I wanted to, I could, I mean, you guys work on the online as well. So you have the sense of kind of how divisive the internet can be. And I see, and I've said this before, but I see the divisiveness of it and the shutting down of conversation to be kind of a problem, especially if we want to kind of solve problems because complexity and nuance are key to those things. And a variety of voices are also key. So, you know, I feel in a sense that there are certainly braver people than I who actually will voice their own opinion on the topic. Maybe they're an expert on a certain subject and they do get shot down. They do really, you know, every day for those people, um, it's, it's hate after hate after, you know, just coming through that inbox, this kind of thing. And I thought maybe I have quite a unique way of being able to tackle these subjects. I feel like I have a tool in a skill set that allows me to be somewhat protected and it's a privilege that not a lot of people have. So I want to use it in a way that can help, I guess. Yeah. And if the main objective of making things on the internet was not to get yelled at, the solution is simple. Just don't make things on the internet. Yeah. But clearly, I mean, success cannot be first and foremost defined by have no one get upset or the only solution is do nothing. If you do something, if you think things, if you ask questions, it's going to be provocative to someone. And if you are talented to the level that you are Barnaby, I mean, good stuff rises to the top. It's not a surprise that a gajillion people watch what you make. Like the law of averages say people are going to get mad. I don't know. I suppose that begs the question, what is success for you? What do you hope happens when you make a video on the internet that tackles a difficult topic? I don't know. I mean, it's interesting that there are a lot of people that make quite lighthearted videos that don't have an element of, I don't know what it would be, that just want to simply entertain. And I'm content to do that too to a degree because I think there is certainly merit in making fun, creative, pretty lovely, funny videos that can really help diffuse situations, especially if there is an element of social unrest online. It's like, it's nice to duck out into those places. I don't think people should feel they have to do this, for example. I feel people already are doing a lot of good when they're creating fun, entertaining content. I think because I had the tool and the ability to find a way to do it that was that could potentially be effective. So I got so part of it, the motivation is curiosity. It's like how how effective could this be? And could I get away unscathed, so to speak, you know, if it works and there is very minimal blowback and people have listened, then it's a success. If there's a lot of blowback for an approach that is very measured, then it highlights an issue. So in both instances, I think it can be deemed a success. You see what I'm saying? Hey, this episode of No Dumb Questions is brought to you by Away Away. And this is, I'm going to read it. I'm just coming to nail this thing is a modern lifestyle brand that creates thoughtful products for every traveler and every kind of trip. Dustin, how would you say that in a way that doesn't sound corporate? Uh, basically Away has spent a lot of time thinking about the design of suitcases. Now, this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately because when I drive on the road, for some reason, I don't know why I've been thinking about civil engineers recently. I'm looking at like the way a exit ramp is built or I'm looking at like where signs are in particular. I don't know why, but signs, some signs are in the dumbest places. Example, an example would be at the airport where you walk in a door and it says ticketing that way and it has an arrow to the right and ticketing that way. And it has an arrow to the left. That happened to me in Pittsburgh recently. I'm like, what are you doing? Yeah, that's very unhelpful. Who can I blame for this? Is this a civil engineer? Is this a, uh, an airport planner? What, what's going on? Why are we not making it super clear? I know you're making a point and it's important to me, but I need to tell you my horrible sign placement story because I don't know how we haven't talked about this. Okay. We're supposed to be doing an ad, but this is fascinating. We are. This counts. It's all counts. Go ahead. Very early in the pandemic when the masks were still kind of, ah, do we do this? Do we not do this? And everybody had, you know, a different corporate take on it really, really early. Like when only a few big box stores were open, I went to a big lumber yard kind of retail place. And it's one of those places that has the aggressive sliding doors. Where you walk in and it just parts like an old West saloon. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Like star and something. Yeah. Exactly. And this place loves signs. And so all of the doors are all covered in signs and there's always people going in and out. So the doors are always open and they've got one of those vent things that keeps the hot air and cold air on whatever side they wanted to go in. So I understand that there are sliding doors, but they're always open because people are going to a laminar flow curtain. Yeah. Is that what it's called? It was. That's basically how it works. They make a sheet of laminar flow in between the inside and outside. And then it's hard for just air to like conductively go through. But anyway, go ahead. I like standing under those like a golden retriever and just rolling my head around with my eyes closed. We're making a point. We're also going to tell people about a way, but keep going. I know we're going to. It's going to be great. And so what happened was I walked in and nobody, the mask thing was brand new. Nobody was doing it yet. So I walked in and have a mask on. No, nobody's thinking that way. And I walk around for a while and somebody approached me and they were polite and they're like, OK, you know, you need to wear a mask. Because like, I, you guys should put up a sign or something. And there's like, she's like, there's one right on the front door. The one that slid open all the time. So they stuck it right on the door. But the door is always slid open because if the if you walk up to it, it opens and then it hides the sign behind other signs. And I just thought that was really poor planning on their part, but I went and got a mask anyway. I know sign placement story. Yeah, it's it's a thing. Like people don't think about how other people will use the product, in this case, the product being the sign. For example, when you exit the airport at Huntsville, you walk up to the where you pay your ticket for the parking thing. And there's like four signs and it and I instantly know what happens. I was like, OK, an engineer, probably a mechanical engineer like me designed this ticket machine and it's got like, Hey, insert your ticket here and then insert your credit card here. But what happens is you insert your ticket and then a bright light comes on blinking and says, insert whatever here and you insert your credit card. And it's like, no, that's not what you were supposed to do. You were supposed to do this other thing. And I'm just like, what? I kid you not. I have used that system at that airport and my wife can vouch. My comment was how in a city full of engineers, could they not get this right? It was the most obtuse thing. I've ever worked with. I know exactly what you're talking about. Oh, exactly. And so I told the person's like, Hey, you did it wrong. I was like, no, I didn't do it wrong. You designed it wrong. And if you bought this, you bought a port aside because I'm not an idiot. So anyway, what I'm trying to say is you should buy some luggage from away because this is what they designed thoughtfully. Yeah. That's what they do. Yes. Yes. What they do is they stop and they think about like, how does a human interact with luggage? What is everything a person might want to do with their luggage? And we're going to design it for that. Step one, they're probably going to want to roll it around. So we've got these really cool wheels on the bottom and they're 360 degree spinners because you might want to roll it one way and then the other without having to like organize your feet and shovel it around to reorient your luggage. You just want your luggage to follow you. So that's number one. Number two, you're probably going to want it to not break. So they got this whole big polycarbonate design or it's like amazing. I say big, but it's not big. It's just like a really well designed polycarbonate material. Material scientist involved in some level, it seems. I had an experience with that two days ago. We've got a weird shaped closet downstairs and I don't know who did it. Probably a kid putting things away. I opened the door and they had made a tower of stuff. Like, what is this? And I opened the door and immediately the tower of stuff teeters over. I think it's a prank or something, but it wasn't. I really honestly believe that was what they thought putting things away. It looked like and right at the very top was my sand colored polycarbonate away bag and it crashed the farthest, six and a half feet, something like that. And even as it was in mid air, I was like, this is no threat whatsoever because I know that is not going to break upon contact with the ground. But it didn't. It's solid, but it's squishy. Is that I don't know if that's an OK way to say it. I don't know if they'd want me to say it that way, but that's how I feel about it. Yeah, Ben Ben don't break is a good way to say it. Like it has the ability to take a punch, absorb the energy and not actually get damaged or damage other things. It's really great. So that's the second thing. The third thing is they've they've realized that people usually use luggage like this when you're on an airplane. So we're going to make it at the exact specific dimension required by the TSA in order to count as a carry on. No bigger, no smaller. It is the perfect dimension to get the maximum amount of stuff onto the plane with you and follow the rules. So I just really appreciate that engineers took the time to design all this stuff that works within the realm of operational, you know, whatever, like how I'm going to use it, that's what they designed it for. That's where we're at. I'm now going to read the promo code to people so they know what they can get. It's totally worth it. Here's the deal. Start your 100 day trial and shop the entire way lineup of travel essentials, including the best selling suitcases at away travel dot com slash in DQ. That's a way travel dot com slash in DQ. You can get the roll around bags. They have the carry on and the bigger carry on. They also have these interesting other types of luggage like they have a cloth bag that you know, the handle that you pull up on your way bag, Matt? Yes. This is a cloth bag that is like a duffel bag, but it has a little slot. So it'll just slide over that handle and it stays in place. So you just carry your your one bag and this bag just rides on top. It's pretty cool. Well, I just recently got that. I have not had an opportunity to travel with it yet, but I'm excited about it. And they get the people are going to do that. They're going to buy new luggage. They're going to buy a bag and then they're not going to travel for a while. So all of these products come with a hundred day trial time so that whenever you do get around to actually traveling, you're not feeling under pressure to travel right this second in case you need to return it, they're very confident. You're going to like it. We're very confident you're going to like it. You get a hundred days to try it out. Absolutely. So anyway, that's the deal, but I want to talk to you at some point in the future about the design of things that people interact with. I think it's fascinating. What's the guy's name? 99% invisible. That's like part of what he does, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a UX design podcast. Yeah, I mean, it is a fascinating thing. I think about which direction doors open. I think about light switches. Like what is the correct hype for a light switch? Why and why is the distance between the door frame to the light switch? Why is that also important so you know where the light switch is going to be? And there's something built into the brain that there's some endorphin or thing that I know must happen when things fit and seem right. There's a human impulse toward order. And I notice it with a waybags. I have never ever been questioned or hassled about anything from someone who works at an airport within a waybag. It's like a fast pass when I'm working with the airline people getting on the plane because they know it's to the right specifications. It's like in their brains, they can picture where that's going to fit and how that's going to fit. Whereas weird off brand stuff. You don't get that same immediate recognition where everybody's brain involved in the equation knows it's going to work. Yeah, it's awesome. Away travel.com slash in the queue, 100 day trial. You're not going to need the 100 day trial. You're going to keep it. But anyway, there it is. Thanks for sponsoring the sponsors, everybody. And thanks to the sponsors for sponsoring the program. That's what makes it all go round. All right, let's go back to the conversation, buddy. Question here, when you make a piece of content for the Internet and you know, it might be controversial, like you did know going forward with this video. Yeah. Do you anticipate the comments ahead of time and do you try to change the content based on the comments you think that may emerge? I think you have to be sensitive to people's mindset if you want them to be receptive to it. I think there's a difference between compromising what you want to put out by being overly sensitive or being overly apologetic when you don't feel that way. And doing it to try and meet people halfway, I would say. And there's a balance to be struck there. And that's what I was certainly trying to do. Let's talk more about the concept of comments in general. I'm sure it's been on your mind a lot over the last few weeks since you published that video. It's interesting to consider how they affect us, the people who put things on the Internet. Most stuff doesn't get through the armor every now and then some cleverly worded comment does. I suppose what pushes my buttons most are accusations of intellectual dishonesty instead of just articulating a disagreement. Yeah. Well, tell me why I'm wrong. If it's so if I'm so wrong that you could accuse me of being a liar because it's so obvious, you should have no trouble then just pointing out the flaws in my argument or the lack of data gathered. So that one, I wouldn't say it hurts, but it makes me want to respond and I have to tell myself not to. It uks you. Yeah. The other one that gets me is the accusation of laziness or stupidity. You just didn't do your work. And again, I would just say, well, if it's so obvious, then it should be no trouble for you to demonstrate the work I should have done. I suppose everybody's got their little thing and it's fun to unpack what might get through the armor for somebody like you or me or Destin here. But I'm kind of interested right now in your grand take on the whole proposition of comments in general. How do you think that's shaping the world? What kind of feedback loop do you feel like that's creating? Are we better for having them or would we be better off without them? I don't know, to be honest. I mean, in my comment section, I try to think if I have ever deleted comments, I could probably count the instances on one hand, maybe when I know someone to be lying, for example, or something like this, it's so minimal. Literally maybe less than five times in the whole history of my channel or someone being very rude to another comment or something like this. Just like that's I'd like hope I deleted before they see it, something like that. I don't know. But I think conversation is important. And even if you don't agree with someone's opinion, at least you know what they're thinking or at least what they want to express. What I'll tell you what I'll explain is when people say that I have deleted comments in the video and it's like that's exactly the opposite of what I'm trying to do. I know the best way to start a conversation is not likely name calling. So I know some of these comments have merit and some of them are probably going to be dead in the water. But if they're going to be dead in the water, just let them float there for a bit. That's my feeling. Well, so that's an interesting question because I think that comments on the internet make a lot of sense if we know that the comments are real, but I did this whole misinformation series online. I happen to believe a significant percentage of comments on the internet are not real. Interesting. Yeah, I don't know what that number is. I mean, let's just say non-zero. And so I find it interesting that you've heard of comment brigading. You've heard of this. So it's like if you have a community online, let's say that Barnaby Dixon makes a video about green Legos being the best Lego. And I'm in a subreddit about red Legos, right? And I'm going to have problems. Yeah, we're going to have problems, right? So I go to my little subreddit and I'm like, hey, Barnaby Dixon's made this. He's got this stupid fish that's talking about how green Legos should be allowed. And we all know that our red Legos are superior. Let's go to the comment section and let's blow it up. Oh, by the way, there's a hundred thousand followers of the red Lego subreddit. And so you start comment brigading and you just go over there and relentlessly go after it. That's a thing. And so I would call that coordinated behavior. And so these types of things happen and it's, you know, they're, I don't know what the countermeasures are for certain things like this. And there's there's other things that that happen that are, you know, AI driven. I mean, I've seen it on Smarter Every Day. And so I think that it's very, very difficult. The more people that assemble in a place, the more power is it they're like hills, like in a war, right? And like the more people and money assemble in one place, the more valuable that spot of ground on the internet becomes. It's like the thing that happened on Reddit a while back where you could pay a certain amount of money for a pixel. And oh, yes, that was fascinating. Or actually you didn't pay money. You just actually could change the pixel. So you could only do it within like an hour window and then you have to wait like another hour, something like that, right? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And so I remember that it became very important to coordinate in groups and they became very important to concentrate your fire on a certain place. And so as more people gather in a certain place, it becomes more important to concentrate fire in terms of internet idea, willpower. I don't know how to articulate it, but I think you get what I'm saying. I do. I think I mean, there's obviously bots and there's there's people that aren't actual. Well, I was going to say people aren't people, robots, algorithms or whatever it is, that aren't actual people commenting. And I can see that could certainly be a problem or people. I don't know. They're trying to cause some degree of unrest. So they're saying what they're I could spot some of these people in the comment section who it seems somewhat obvious to me that that wasn't actually their position, but they were just trying to stir things up. So yeah, of course, they're exercising their voice, but they're not really speaking with their own voice in a sense. I mean, but when it comes to people coming from a different site, for example, I would say that a lot of the people on who are commenting more critical things on my video probably came from Twitter and they weren't likely followers of me either. So what would happen is someone would share. Well, first of all, it happened as I would share a clip of the video. And if that clip was deemed to be contentious as most clips in that video was, the person would share it ironically getting it a lot more views and a lot more eyeballs and a lot more. It's very interesting, this whole thing. But anyway, so a lot of people would come to my YouTube page and leave a comment and leave a downvote, this kind of thing in a sense. You get the sense that like it's more important to some of these people to be seen to be against something than to not than to accidentally get some exposure. You know what I mean? It's the signaling that they are for or against something. If they truly believed it was harmful, then they wouldn't share it. I would say, yet they do with their opinion on it. So like my sense is that. Oh, interesting. That they're keen for people to know they're against it as opposed for keen for people not to see it. I think that's very well said. That's fascinating. It's very insightful. And and that what you said right there, that observation comes back to this organic truth of having comments be a primary way in which we engage with each other. Yeah. Remember, this wasn't how we engaged with each other until half of a young lifetime ago. Yeah. I go back and watch episodes of community from the mid to late 2000s and I can tell it was before commenting was how we talked. The jokes are different. The virtue signals are different. And then something happens about season three or season four on that very show. And you can tell that right there, right between that episode. And that episode is when we hit the inflection point on where most of our communication happens. Now we're in the commenting world. It happened right there. Yeah. And I would I would come back to this truth of not just the internet, but of everything, whatever you incentivize, that's what people will do. Sometimes we intentionally incentivize things with tax policy or central planning. Sometimes just the medium that we use incentivizes certain behavior. Well, here's the thing. If we all go to a high school together and we hang out, the most represented part of the distribution of comments and opinions is going to be the big bell in the middle. You can tell with your eyeballs, like, ah, you know, so and so has an opinion. It isn't really working for them. And it doesn't look super healthy. I want to include that person and be kind. But this isn't the person you want shaping all of the ideas for everybody. Probably they're not in that moment in life right now where everything's working great. You can see that when the commenting is happening in humanity and our full physical interaction and being present with each other is on display. But in the comment section, what's rewarded is not the bell in the middle. What's rewarded is the fringiest ends of the distribution. And the more that gets rewarded, the more that draws engagement, the more that pleases the various algorithms that are built to reward engagement, the more that seems normative and the more the giant bell in the middle of generally healthy, pretty much middling, live in, live, you got your opinion. I got mine. We could talk about it whatever crowd that crowd gets pushed down and flushed out into the more rewarded ends of the distribution. And so we're seeing something happening here that feels almost unnatural in terms of human interaction as the fringiest stuff is what seems to be rewarded. And the normalist stuff just remains quiet. I think the middle of the bell is wildly underrepresented in the comment section. Yeah, the bill is flat, isn't it? Yeah, I'm looking I'm looking here at the reviews on the Notom Questions podcast on Apple podcast. And thankfully, there's a lot of positive reviews. The overwhelming majority or positive reviews, every once in a while, you get you get some negative ones in there and the negative ones are pretty telling about the person that left the comment. This is a person not what was promised. I agree that there are no them questions, but these are dumb podcasts, but there are dumb podcasts. And all this podcast was going to be intellectually stimulating instead. Two guys talked about nothing related to the title and the fact of the substance for all 10 minutes. Yeah. Pretty disappointing. That's a word I see quite a bit in negative comments. Oh, it said pretty disappointing at the end of the comment. It did. It said pretty disappointing. That word, for some reason, I see that word show up in negative comments all the all the time. I am disappointed, disappointing. Interesting. My last guest mentioned in one of the answers that I cut out, not because she didn't want included, but because I had to sort of try and get it to fit within a certain timeframe. She mentioned that a lot of the people commenting angry things quite have quite a lot of trouble kind of advocating for themselves in real life. And you wonder sort of if they resort to these tactics because in the maybe kind of like a solipsistic way or something, this would be what would work on them. You know, what do you mean? Well, I guess that if they do have trouble advocating for themselves and someone came at them with a lot of hate, then it would be an effective way of getting them to shut up. Do you see what I mean? It's like so they see that as that they're kind of using the poison that they would be used on them that would be effective on me thinking it would be effective. Wow, wow, wow. That's such a good thing. Interesting. And it is not mine. It was from from my guest. I'll give you credit or the fish credit. It's a good take. This is telling you started to say in the comment and I was like, that is so true about other people. And then you kept going one one thousand two and somewhere around eight one thousand. I was like, and it's also true for me. When I comment, I got two techniques. Now I got three. One is just genuinely thankful. Ah, thanks. Glad you liked the thing. That's great. Just very sincere. Thank you. Approach number two is I L.O. Well, the dumbest stuff. Like people come in crazy hot flame throwers going. Their facts aren't even straight. I'll do the L.O.L. I'm sorry you feel that way. I would encourage you to reconsider how you connect with people on the internet. I don't think this will achieve the things you want to achieve because I say stuff like that because that would burn you the most because that would work on me. Yes, work on me is a kind response. A wow, dude, what are you doing? Be self aware because one of my biggest fears is being even less self aware than I am right now, the cringiest, most painful moments for me to look back on are the ones where I went big and I embarrassed myself in front of everyone because I just didn't get the room. I didn't get reality. And so why do I make those comments because I know it would work on me. And then the other one that I'll do is a little bit of snark. If somebody hits me with an ill-informed comment, I will come back with a little bit of sarcasm. Somebody yelled at me one time for using an analogy is like cars or something to talk about the Bible. And they're like, what kind of idiot bastardizes the Bible by likening it to cars? And I came back and I was like, yeah, that's almost as stupid as some idiot likening the word of God to seeds or soil. And the point being like Jesus uses tons of illustration talking about the word of God. And the reason I made the comment, it had nothing to do with that person. I never I never even thought about whether that would affect them or move the needle for them or help them or be empathetic to them. The reason I make those kinds of comments is because I know they would work on me. This is a very eye opening moment for me and it will change the way I respond to comments on the internet. So thank you. Oh, interesting. Well, you know, another of my guests said, and this was this was Martin. I don't I'm sure he wouldn't mind me saying this, but he said all criticism is projection as well. And I think that plays into it to a degree as well. I couldn't say what he meant by that. I mean, I think he could mean did you see me staring to the corner of the room being like, that sounds like the same way that sounds profound. And I feel like I should understand it. I think I'm an idiot. I think I should see. I mean, I've been thinking about it for a bit too. And sometimes I get glimmers of understanding it and sometimes I'll make enough. But I think in this context, yeah, you're projecting your own sensibilities on someone else. So whatever would hurt them, you are sending their way as a means of being effective. So in a sense, you're projecting yourself onto that person as a means of having the comment be effective in the way that you want it to be. Now, now what's interesting, though, is when when I make a video and I put it on the internet or just generally in my interactions with people, for example, I just finished a video with indie film lab. They make photography, you know, they develop film and things like that. And I asked them on the phone, I was like, Hey, you just did this entire video thing with me. Can you give me some negative feedback because negative feedback is something, you know, it's great to hear that people liked what you did, but it's only in the negative feedback that I can grow because I can find the things that didn't work and I can fix them and make them better. And so I will genuinely inquire for negative feedback. Yeah. What's interesting is when people offer negative feedback on the internet, I'm less likely to take it because it's typically what you're saying. There's a bit of a sting to it. Like the negative feedback I often see on the internet is meant to hurt me or meant to create pain. Right. Right. And I wonder if if the person leaving the feedback, you know, did the sandwich technique, you know, good, then bad, then good, I wonder if they would actually help me. That's interesting. We did this one thing one time, Matt and I kind of gamed it out together. We had a person that made this really weird video on the internet and we wanted to help them. And so we kind of gamed out how to leave the comment. And the first thing was, hey, thank you so much for, you know, we did the sandwich thing, good, bad, good. And it was a genuine moment where we had an opportunity to speak into this person's life offline and I think move the needle in the right direction. Matt, I think you know what I'm talking about. I do. What I tend to do with comments is just not comment. I take the Ben Franklin approach. He said that people would write him really nasty letters. And he would read the letter, internalize it. The next time he saw them in the public square, he would say something nice to him as if the letter had never been written. And he said that would just destroy them because they were just so angry because they really needed him to drink a little bit of that. Is there a level of vindictiveness in that as well? Because I know I think he's doing the metagame, but the dictiveness makes you kind and forgiving towards someone. That's my kind of. Yeah, he could make the world go round. That's a tasty poison. I guess what Barnaby's saying is it's a matter of the heart, though, like, or if you're doing it for the wrong wrong reasons. Yeah, motivations are fascinating, actually. I think artists as, and yeah, I guess I'm an artist doesn't sound too pretentious. I think I, you know, we have a privilege to navel gaze, you know, and that can go a bit crazy at points, but there's there definitely is. Again, I talked about this with Martin, actually. Sometimes your navel becomes like a magnifying glass that you can examine the world through, but sometimes you just get your head stuck in your belly button and you go nowhere with it, you know. So you can when it comes to kind of analysis of motivations, which is, which is really important if you're going to do something, especially if you think there's a moral component to it, I think. And I think that's important. I might have just not finished that sentence properly, but I think that's important because the people coming after you on occasion, or at least the people that came after me are very convinced that they are on the side of love and they're standing up to hate. I'm fairly certain when they're typing these comments that they must be feeling that kind of those emotions associated with hate because you can hear the venom as they type almost, you know, as you read the comments back. So that disassociation that they have, I think, as a result of not examining their motivations in enough detail, you know, or maybe at all, or just assuming they're on the right side of history so they can type whatever they want to signal that it's fundamentalism. This is what the pendulum is just swung. The fundamentalism I grew up with as a kid was overwhelmingly born out of a religious context in my country. It was overwhelmingly born out of a Protestant evangelical context. There were a lot of nice things that also came out of that. But the wing of Christianity that we're currently rightly reacting against is the weird fundamentalist controlling. I don't care what the narrative of the Bible is. I want to find phrases that tell other people what to do. And I'm not really interested in the phrases that push back on my preferred behaviors. That hypocrisy was something that came to light in the 80s and 90s. And a lot of people in my generation saw it and were turned off by it. Some of us came out of that thinking, yeah, I think there's still a God. Yeah. Others of us were so burned by it that we came out of it saying, now I don't think there's anything to it. I think it's a control mechanism. Wow. Some of us went through a phase of both. That's what happened to me. And so what I think is going on right now that's probably difficult to detect for a lot of younger internators is that what's happening right now is very much a dialogue with what happened 20 to 40 years ago when evangelicalism and a little bit fundamentalism, that very legalistic, rule oriented expression of evangelicalism when that was the dominant mentality. Now, what is so often the pity when we look back at history and social reactions is that we often react against the thing we don't like with exactly the thing we don't like. We just want to be in charge of it and we want to be in the power position this time around. So in fundamentalism, you have to have in group signaling and you have to have a bad out group just 20 years ago, the bad out group were people who didn't like God, who said naughty words, who had romantic relationships with the wrong kind of person who liked marriage. You want to it's a plant that the kids can dry now. You can smoke it or eat it. I'm told interesting. I look into this. It's becoming very popular in a lot of corners around the world. I hate with productivity. I'm unsure. I hear it aids with appetite. You're a man. So the thing that the thing is it flipped that quick and we shouldn't forget that lesson. This fundamentalism that she was on the other foot. I know time ago in the grand scheme of history and the vast majority of people were overwhelmingly sure they were more elistically on the right side of history. And if they had to burn down a few people who were wrong to make examples of them, you've got to burn down a few people. People were rightly hurt by that. And so they've created a new orthodoxy to say that was screwed up. I didn't like the way it felt. But unfortunately, to me, it feels like so much of that new orthodoxy often manifest in the comments is just punitive. It's an attempt to say that sucked. You mistreated people. Let's see how you like it. Yeah. And I for an eye makes the whole world blind. I am eagerly awaiting the moment when we graduate from this counter reaction, this new orthodoxy with a new in group and a new out group. And I really think that some point people of goodwill are going to win out. We're going to see these big patterns and we can make that pendulum maybe come to rest somewhere a little more in the middle instead of vigorously swinging. I don't think we have to have an out group. I think it's possible for us to get to a place where we ignore those extreme ends of the distribution. We listen to the bell and we treat everybody with patience and tolerance. I think that dream of the West is still alive. I think we can do it. I think it's the bomb that everybody is dying for society. But right now, I feel like the pendulum has swung in a reactionary way against the fundamentalism of old with a fundamentalism of new. And just like we had to wait out the last version of fundamentalism. I feel like we got to wait out this version of fundamentalism. Yeah, you're probably right. I think it will it will require people who are on the side that the the pendulums on already. I sometimes see it as almost like multiple pendulums. Maybe we have a political one, maybe we have a cultural one, maybe we have a social one. So sometimes you'll say the pendulum is so far this way. And they'll say, no. And then they point to maybe the economic one or something like this and say, but look at this, it's like now that there's kind of multiple ones. I think YouTube and the internet is definitely in a certain direction right now. And there are certain mechanisms to stop anyone that they don't trust getting hold of the pendulum and taking more towards the middle from getting hold of it. So people that are the other side of the political spectrum just have no chance of obtaining this pendulum or having any sway over it, sway over it literally. But the people who are on the side that it's kind of reached the extreme on. You know, there are still words that can be leveled at them, but there are less words, I suppose. So I think it is dependent on people who I don't know. It's so hard not to sound kind of preachy. When I say dependent, it's like this has to be people's own volition. You know, they have to they have to do it because they feel it's right, not because they're being bullied into it. So I say have to very tentatively, but I think it would be helpful if they were able to to gain control of the trajectory and to trust the other side to a degree. Yes. Because you have to because it's, you know, trust breeds trust. And if one side has seen the other side, just gripping on white knuckle to this pendulum for 20 years, when they get hold of it, it's like we can make sure they don't get hold of it again because remember what happened last time. So as a result, what happens? White knuckles gripping on the other side. So trust needs to come across the aisle by a kind of, I think, a gesture of good will of the people on the side that it's reached the extreme of to just kind of correct, just slowly, you know, tweak it out of the fingers of these people on the extremes and just let it rest in the middle. And the other side wants to grab it and take it a little way. Don't overreact. You know, things kind of things go in that motion anyway. It's when they get magnetized to the extremes and held hostage there that we get into some problems. That's so well said. And the playbook of the fundamentalist of any type when they most have the pendulum their way and their white knuckling to keep it swung all the way their way is the the danger language that we can't let people think that or say that it's dangerous. People could get hurt. Fair. This is not new. That that use of language was being employed by the exact opposite side 20 to 40 years ago. And this at some point, and this is what I think is the genius of the Western liberal revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, we had seen the English civil war, we'd seen the 30 years war, we'd seen political discord that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and destruction. We'd seen religious discord that created the exact same mess in Europe. We'd seen these mega monarchs who had come along. We want power here. We'd seen the people come along and say, now we're going to kill the monarch and we want power here. And then along come this group of thinkers in the 18th century who are like, we have got to come up with a way to settle this pendulum in the middle. And the key concept was tolerance, religious tolerance, ideological tolerance, lifestyle tolerance. You just got to cut other people some slack. And if we can get everybody to agree to that, then maybe we can get that thing to come to rest in the middle and it can work for everybody. Have we ever fully realized that? Probably not. But I still think this experiment has legs and I'm excited for the next little undulation. I'm hoping we can land it in a better spot. Yeah, absolutely. I get excited. Thanks for tolerating me on that, Barnaby. No, no, I agree entirely. It's interesting. I, you know, I do see a lot of fear being induced in a lot of people these days with the language being used and also the repercussions of the speech that some people are even well meaningly saying. And my first guest actually who is a social scientist or social psychologist, social psychologist, I believe. I think I'm right. She mentioned that when people are scared, they do a lot of thinking with the reptilian part of their brain, which isn't where the best thinking happens. It's kind of like survival, you know. So I think if the more we are scared of the other side or the more we feel victimized, you know, in whatever sphere that could be, that the less cognitive capacity we have to solve the problems that are plaguing us. So Barnaby, receiving all these negative comments, how has it changed the way you comment on the internet? Whoa, good question. I don't know if I do comment on the internet really hardly at all, actually. There's been instances probably in the past where I have engaged and I haven't and in a way that probably as you're saying, like, what would hurt this person? Yeah, absolutely. I've done that when I was younger and it very rarely ends up with a better outcome than if I hadn't said anything at all. So I usually just don't. I use Twitter. I put clips of my videos up on Twitter and I try to be very civil. I remember when things were blowing up, what was it, a month ago that I said, OK, I'm very interested to hear your feedback on this kind of thing. And again, more more hate did come my way, but I did get some interesting suggestions to I think I read all of it. Or maybe I did read or some people say you shouldn't read the comments. I don't know if it really bothered me too much. This is an interesting thing too. Before you embark on this, and I've mentioned it before, you do have to really examine your motivations and you feel like you have to preempt not what people will call you, but what people might call you that could potentially be true. You know, and you kind of I call it all. It sounds very pretentious, but it called I call it like checking your armor. So you sort of punch yourself in a certain area, say, does that hurt? Does this hurt? Does this hurt? And you do that over and over again and you lose a ton of weight and you get really stressed and all this kind of stuff. When people come after you to that particular part of your armor, it's like, guys, I've tried this over and over again. You know how many times you don't know how many times, but it doesn't work. So keep going if you like. Tell yourselves out if you want. Who do you think comments on internet stuff and who do you think doesn't? I would posit that the commenting public is different than the public public. I guess question one is, do you agree with that supposition? And if so, how do you think those two things differ? I remember I used to listen to Howard Stern back in the day and he said this is going to sound so mean, but he said the people that call into radio shows are most often a fair bit done more than the general public. And I wonder if there's a crossover sometimes. Not all the time. Sometimes, like I say, I see some wonderful criticism and some really interesting feedback, but maybe I don't know. I'm not sure where that would be. I'm thinking about it now. So any answer I give wouldn't be well considered, but I kind of wish I could go across all the comments I've ever written on the internet. I'm sure someone at the NSA can and you go back and you look at everything you've ever written and like if there were scales and you're like, generally you were uplifting and edifying to those around you or in general, you were a fun sucker. You kind of took the fun out of everything and you kind of tried to hurt people most of the time. I wonder if there was like a global comment score. You got to believe that such a technology exists. That would turn in black mirror really fast though, too, right? It could. Whatever you incentivize, that's what people will do. So if artificial niceness and uncritical thought is incentivized, then we'd have an artificial niceness and uncritical thought crisis. I'm not saying we should incentivize it. I'm just wondering if if you could measure it, like if it's quantifiable, I'm not saying you should act on the information once you quantify it. But like in general, I wonder if my comments uplift people or if they push people down and I think that would be telling you you're both religious gentlemen. Maybe do you think St. Peter has a list? No, not at all. It's not my view. I've failed on every metric. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. My just the 10 second answer to that is my threat of religious understanding is such that as a person, if there is a deity who's perfect and flawless, I don't stack up. And so any potential for any kind of rightness between me and the first cause of all of existence has to be because of a movement on the part of the first cause who's excellent and perfect and flawless. I have to accept the fact that I am flawed and therefore my list would not be good enough to earn favor with such a deity. But still it would be good to know if you like what kind of actions you left in your wake, meaning like were people motivated to do good after interacting with you or were they motivated to do bad or did they like turn inwardly in a negative way? It would be interesting to know like ideally it would be good to edify others in every interaction. And I think you can edify people with build people up with a negative comment. I think that is possible. In fact, I know it's possible. People do it with me all the time. The people that take me aside and they say, hey, Destin, you know, you know, away from other people and they're like, I know this is what you were trying to do in that moment over there, but it could have come across like this. You might want to reconsider it. Those are the people that I can tell instantly they have my best interest at heart. They want me to be better for me. And I'm going to carefully consider what they say. That's absolutely key. I run this video by a few people that I really, really trust just to get the sense if just to get it from their perspective, I don't want someone that comes at it from the same perspective or that will agree with me. But I do want someone who has my best interests at heart and kind of gets what I'm doing. They don't have to agree or they don't have to be the same type of person, whatever, regardless of the demographic, you know, as long as they have your best interests at heart, you kind of. And it's something you kind of have to employ a little faith on it. But I feel that I have a good sense of who has that and who I can ask with regard to these specific series of videos that I'm doing. So you develop trust with a person and then once you've developed the trust, you can receive the negative feedback in a different way. Maybe that's the problem with internet comments. Maybe we the anonymity to a degree. Maybe we don't have any trust. Perhaps if we had an opportunity to see the humanness of the other side. I think so. I don't know. There's one conclusion, one conclusion that I came to in the misinformation series is if I assume people are human and I treat them as such, it changes everything about how how everything happens in the rest of that particular thread. You know, if you could just find something that's common with the person and you say, hey, I see that you like whatever motorcycles, you know, my dad likes motorcycles too. It's really cool that you do that. So, you know, and I do see where you're coming from on XYZ. I just think that maybe we differ in this one little place and that's OK. Yeah. You know, I think they think if you treat them like a human, then it you can kind of get through that armor instead of just like. Yeah, absolutely. To try and see it from their perspective or try and get a sense of where their heads And you can never really know either. I mean, someone, the analogy is getting up on the wrong side of the bed, some plenty worse things could happen to a person in a morning than that. You know, so it's good to bear those kind of things as possible reasons for a certain behavior or a certain attitude for sure. Yeah, it's just benefit of the doubt thinking, right? I guess it is. To use the example of your video, Barnaby, one of the things that I found difficult to stomach from several of the worst comments I read in your thread were the people who assumed that they did not want the same things as your guest. When who is against everyone thriving? Surely no one from the bell curve. Like maybe there's some people on the wacky ends of the distribution, but they should be relegated. If your opinion is, I don't want other people to thrive and I like suffering. I'm sorry. You're welcome to have that opinion. You're just not really welcome to shape the discussion. You're a jerk. You got a problem. Something's wrong with you. I don't know what it is. I'm sorry for whatever it is. If your parents or something happened at school, if you were a victim, I'm sorry. I'd love to be empathetic and help even with any of that, if I could. But you don't get to bring that disease into the conversation. And everybody who's healthy wants everybody else to thrive, right? Sasha wants that. That's her name, right? Sasha, am I getting the right? Sasha, yeah, Sasha, I got, yeah. She wants everybody to thrive. And I would hope that even the probably very young people who are practicing a version of new moral internet orthodoxy with where that fundamentalism is that currently they need to signal. I think orthodoxy, see, I made a negative comment. I think it surely even those people want everyone to thrive. No one wants all the Democrats or all the Labor Party people or all the Republicans to just wither and die and fail, right? I mean, nobody wants death to all the religious people or all the a religious people or all the whatever group isn't like you. And so if you start with the assumption that odds are that whoever I'm hearing from on the internet would like good things and blessings and flourishing for everybody, if you can even see a glimmer of that in the comment, then it feels like there's some kind of I mean, there's something we can connect on. We have a moral thing in common. My atheist friend who believes things totally differently than me. We both want people to flourish and I'm willing to even put energy into that. And so are you. So wow, we just disagree on how to best achieve it, but it seems like 90% of the conversation is already taken care of. We want the same ends. Let's see how we might reason through different ways to do it. And I might have to land in a place where I'm like, I don't think your strategy is best, but you're giving me some leash to try to do what I think will best help people to thrive and be redemptive and good in the world. So I probably got to give you a little bit of leash to go and do the same. And then we don't we don't have to feel like we have to overcome all these enemies to even try to do good. And it seems like there's a pathway there toward thinking about the comments I encounter a little differently and thinking about the people who I know are out there who really don't like my ideas very much a little differently. That that benefited out. I think it's almost like I mean, we're bound to think very differently. And there's certainly a merit to I'm working on a project currently. And I'm collaborating a lot with really talented people that have a different skillset than I, but also a different way of thinking about things. So we progress in a way because an obstacle to me might not be one to them and something that comes simple to me might not come so easy to them. So it's I guess it's almost like evolution in a sense. Let's try this strategy. Let's try this. But together we move forward if we allow those people to voice their perspectives. You know, I see the benefits of it and I see we could be losing it. If we're not careful, I guess I've got a question, Barnaby. What's next for philosophy? Oh, I don't know. Well, for the for the next few months, I'm I'm working on this collaborative theatre project for a while and I was very keen to get that video kind of done and out of my headspace because it just consumed me really for a long time. And this follow up video to that I'm working on is doing somewhat the same. But I'm dropping it tomorrow, I believe, at least as we record this, I don't want to become a one directional thing. I do like the ability to explore these tougher subjects from a perspective that is kind of neutral, but also safe and frivolous and funny and entertaining in the way that I can make it that way. But also there are many interesting people in the world and there are many interesting subjects in the world outside of things that are controversial. So I think my video with Martin was an example of that, you know, the guy who has Wintergarten, that channel, wonderful, you know, creative dude. And you learn a lot from these people, really. And they don't have to have a heterodox perspective to make the series worth doing, I guess. I'm having to Google heterodox because I don't know what it means. Tell me in case I said it, Rob. I would define it as orthodoxy is the safe thing. Heracy is the absolutely forbidden perspective. heterodox is you're still under the umbrella of acceptable thought, but barely, pal heterodox is another set of ideas, but that could be articulated in a way that still barely conforms to accepted norms. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so, something like an alternative perspective, perhaps. Maybe that's the way I think of it. Some Catholics view Protestants as heterodox. Oh, OK. So it has a kind of religious some Catholics view Protestants as heretics. Interesting. OK. Yeah, I guess some people did view my guest as a heretic and me as a heretic for having her on. I think the parallels do hold true. Well, Barnaby, thanks for thanks for kicking this stuff around with us. You know, I thought you were going to be on fire when we got you on here. Like as much as the flame war was kind of directed at you, but you're not. You kind of knew this was going to happen and you walked into it willingly, which is strange on the internet that feels like bravery in a weird way. Matt, is that what you're smelling? I'm not sure I want to say out loud the text. I sent you, but it was complimentary to Barnaby in an anatomical way regarding the video that he put out. That's very sweet of you guys. I think it's you just did the math. Yes. It was a very lovely, lovely message that you sent over. I mean, it's it's only people getting upset. They're only, you know, they're only typing things to me. There's been people throughout history that have been put up against a wall and shop for things and this is this really is nothing comparatively. And even today, there are people who are saying their own opinion online and getting shut down and I would imagine that feels a lot more like a personal attack and feels much more, you know, difficult for that reason. It isn't easy. That's for sure. And it wasn't very practical professionally for the line of work that I do to even pursue this, but there are much braver people out there than I for sure, for sure. Present day, for sure, by a long way. Goodness. I think it reflects well on you that you would be flustered by the accusation of bravery. What can they really do? Yeah. This is just to try and balance out with a little bit of ego, but I do something very unique that no one else does and it entertains people in a way that no one else is entertaining people really with this specific skill set that I've cultivated. It's like they can't really take that away and it will still be entertaining for people. So I think even if I might have shot myself in the foot professionally in some ways, I feel I will still be able to make a living doing this, you know, whatever happens. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I just make puppet films. Well, a lot of people are brave and their bravery is mingled with being a jerk. Brave is dime a dozen on the internet. If people are screaming into their echo chamber with their video, it gets credit for being brave from some, but it's not really brave. It's incredibly safe to say things that your crowd are going to love and fawn over you for and defend you for when the people who disagree come along. I think it's actually called keyboard courage, right? Yeah. Keyboard card. Yeah, that's right. What's brave is to intentionally humbly invite the people to the conversation who are likely to get angry and treat them with respect and show concern for how they will hear the conversation and what it would be like for them to be in the conversation, which you did. That's brave. So would meekness be a better word? Meekness. I don't know. Look, again, I know, Barnaby, that you are not saying here are all the positions I hold. So it's not like I can say, well, yeah, you went out and showed kindness to your enemies, but you showed kindness to people who you knew would be angry, who would become your enemy for even raising the conversation. But you raised it in a way that instead of playing to a certain base, yeah, respectfully invited all sides to a conversation. I think they see me as their enemy. I don't feel I'm their enemy. I think I'm not angry at them. I don't think what they're doing is productive, but I feel bad them in a lot of ways because I think they in a sense that they almost it feels like they're possessed or something. It's not them. It's the idea in a way. And I think a lot of these people are very young and still have a lot of learning to do and a lot of perspective to gain, but they're just they're making themselves the vessel of this thing as opposed to embodying it. So I don't know. That's I don't want to assume the worst of them. I don't think I do believe the worst of them either. But here's here's a reality. The people who come in sizzling hot and say crazy crap on the internet. Those people don't pay bills. Those people don't click on ads. They're not vested. People who say stuff like that are not vested. Vested people calculate a little bit. They're measured. They think to themselves, OK, these are other humans. We do business together. We interact together. I only get one name. I need to be a little bit smart about what I use it on. I can't just set the dial to 10 on every single opinion and everything. And people who do that, they don't own things. They don't build things. They don't make things. Their chief export is rage and rage isn't worth much. It can be momentarily harvested by the right little branding moment here there. But it's no long term strategy to make things work. And so the people who ripped you a new one online. Those aren't the people who ultimately the the economics of the whole thing are about the silent non-commenting public. Those are the people who drive the engine of internet commerce and drive the engine of valuable views, valuable clicks anyway. I think if we cater too much to try to make the crazy distribution, the far ends of the distribution happy, it's actually economically foolish on our behalf as well because it alienates the gigantic, healthy middle. And so I man, I think you will only thrive because of the decisions you've made and how you've navigated this. It might be the case. Yeah, fingers crossed. Yeah, it's I don't mean to sound kind of like that. There is certainly times when I do get angry at the comment section. And it's a difficult compromise because you have to lean into your own ridiculous anger to figure out what Dabchik would say, but you don't want the anger to be driving it. I don't stew in it and I try not to feed it and I try not to react to it in a way that's going to be negative. So so hopefully I'll do that with this response coming out soon. Fingers crossed. I'm going back to our text messages. I hope you're OK with me revealing the fact that you said I'm just going to summarize you said something about making a video and just reading the text. I tried to discourage you from that and I rereading what I wrote. It seems like I'm implying that response would be weakness is just trying to psycho analyze myself here. It's like, hey, man, you've done a you've done a good thing. Why do you feel like you need to defend it? You actually gave a voice to someone who didn't have a voice. What are you worried about? Are you worried about your reputation? And I noticed you you went into all these one word answers. I was thinking very hard. You got me thinking you probably saw me typing for like 10 minutes at a time before I even gave you this one word. I think he plays me. You're in a very thinking place. I think this is fascinating. I think I think your interaction with internet comments is very different than many people's because because of how you're I mean, you're actually about to do something crazy. You're going to respond to the commenters nuts. And the response is it's hilarious and it's genius and it's disarming. It's peak, well, welling a comment. It's OK. Well, if we're going to clown it up, let's clown it up all the way. And it's it's funny for something so big not to have to have happened on my channel and for Dabchik, a reactive week and flawed character, not to have paid tribute to it to some degree. It seemed kind of off brand to his character too. I mean, you have to embrace your flaws and I'll say, you know, there's definitely there's certainly bad reasons why I'm doing this as well. No motivation is completely pure. I'm sure there's ego all wrapped up in this and I'm sure there's kind of wanting to show people what for some degree, you know, no, I don't think any motivations appear. I try and I hope the majority of them are and I get the sense they are when I get some of the feedback from the people that it helped because the comments don't emerge. Sorry. The comments don't emotionally floor me like they do. Sorry. It's better. They are doing some sense. So good. That's all good. The comments don't emotionally fly you like they do. There is the positive responses. Goodness. They the ones when when I get a kid or something saying like I hadn't heard this perspective and now this has helped, you know, if people want to emotionally affects me, that's the way to do it. So you're saying the positive the positive comments are actually the thing that that hit home. And so how much how many negative comments are worth one positive comment? For I think as many as you like, really. What is the positive comment? Oh, you're going to I can text you. It's hard to really like that. It I would say I'll give it a go. I mean, I think they'll say they say something like this was something I was struggling with. These are the main piece. This is something I was struggling with. I hadn't heard it articulated in this way and this helps me. This helps me see it from a fresh perspective and and you've added some nuance and you know, these decisions that some of these kids are making are very serious and will affect them potentially for the rest of their lives, you know, and those decisions require new ones to understand them correctly. And so to introduce a little bit more nuance than they would have had before feels really, really good because the world has a lot of people in, but for this for one person, that's, you know, that's everything for them. So in a sense, you've changed everything. It feels that's why it gets to me, I think. Sometimes I encounter that kind of stuff myself. I have a tough time relaying it. I try to share some of those with my friend here just so that I have something to do with it, but I would like to be redemptive. I would like my videos to be funny and have fart jokes and I would also like for them to be redemptive to maybe help with something. And in this kind of situation, like we were talking about off mics as we were just getting set up and everything, the subject matter that you chose to deal with in that video affects people at a hundred levels of their identity. It is a gigantic thing and a hundred levels of what happens next. Many of the kids you're hearing from are kids who are trying to make a decision about whether or not to forgo what it is to be a biological parent. That will happen in a lot of instances. Yeah. It's a gigantic question, gigantic and set aside all politics here and just go to human empathy. Yeah. That is a gigantic question for a 30 year old to try to figure out, should we have kids right now, honey or should we not let alone some kid who's 15 and getting picked on and who doesn't feel like they fit in with stuff. And now just tag on to that, make a decision right now about whether or not you'll ever have children. It gets it gets to the heart of things in a hurry. And so I'm not surprised at all that you heard that stuff, but I'm really glad you did. I'm glad it affected you. I'm open to the idea, honestly, that it could help people. I don't know. I don't that the science is so new that it would be wrong with me to fall in any direction, but you don't need science to understand that this is a monumental decision for a lot of these people and also that a huge part of the conversation is being shut down. I'll just one more point. I had a comment today saying, you know, as a result of me not being from a certain demographic or this, like, I don't have any skin in the game. And I think that's so contentious, really. It's I think that's the word contentious. It's everyone should everyone has skin in the game. This is our game. Definitely. You're so it's a hard thing, man. So so this came from a very, very deep place for you. It hasn't affected anyone directly. I know really. I mean, it's just I think when you do the research on this, you kind of you get the sense of a one sided thing happening and we need, especially with with new pursuits of science, we need all the brains we can get. So we can't we can't cut our brains in half here and only use, you know, a part of it. So I don't mean to seem so silly. Oh, come on, Barnaby. This is the good stuff. We're we're. Yes. So it's it seems to me that you made this beautiful thing. And it was it was scary to make. I know it was scary for you to make because of the conversations we had. You put it out there and I'm thinking about some of these really dark beasts like in Lord of the Rings, like these big cloud monsters, things with fire all over them. But like the internet, you know, at least the vocal parts of some of the internet rose up against you, but like it was these little bitty beacons of light out beyond the monsters that you saw and you're like, ah, it was worth it. I don't know. The positive response is like the ones I mentioned, feel more real. I don't know how else to explain it, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. I can't say I know what's what's right on on this subject, but I do know that if I I do know that if we want to solve problems, we have to have the people who are well meaning and smart and Sasha is certainly well meaning. I think for people to deny her compassion is like they're walking with their eyes closed, you know, and to she's a she's a therapist. She's yes, maybe she doesn't have the lived experience of a trans person, but she has hundreds of gender questioning, you know, youth that she talks to. And I think that combined experience is worth a lot, you know, and I don't have the lived experience of being divorced, but I've done marital and premarital counseling for decades. You learn some stuff. I can be empathetic to that without living it. It feels segregationalist, doesn't it? It feels like we can't consider what this person is going through because we are not the right, the same skin color, the same gender. So it's like the way we overlap is so much greater than the, you know, it's like that bell curve, these as well. You know, it's it it works in this context too. It's it's going to make people ask, OK, well, why should I try to empathize them? If I if I can never do it and that doesn't end well either. We keep talking about Sasha. How did you meet her? How do you know her? I know Sasha from a video series that she does with an interview, but she actually has a podcast of her own called gender a wider lens that she does with a psychotherapist based in Ireland called Stella O'Malley. And they basically talk about gender questioning teens and look at it from this particular angle, an angle that people might not necessarily hear so often. Interesting. So if I were to be made a video, you invited someone to speak at the table that normally doesn't have a seat at the table and you let them speak and a lot of people yell that you and so I would just like to know what what is your response in general, like we'll just end it with you. Let you have the last word here. What are your thoughts in general about commenters on the internet? Not sure, really. Goodness. Well, I wish them well. I could, I honestly, I do. So I could just leave it there perhaps.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 2.6, "text": " Matt, I've noticed you make a lot of things on the internet.", "tokens": [50363, 4705,
