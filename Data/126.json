Am I wearing pants? Uh, no. Oh, nope. Sorry, from this angle, it kind of blended in. Yes, you are. I do have a knife. Yeah, I need that, please. Because years ago, you sent me the package I'm holding in my hands here. Ooh. It's addressed to Fox Thunder glare. Do not open yet. It's all in caps. Let me see. Is this handwriting? Hmm. I typed that out. You typed that out. That's from... That really typed that out. Yeah, you did it. You typed that out. No, somebody else typed it out because you ordered it through your hand. It's from somebody else's return address. So you made them type... I did make them type Fox Thunder glare and you made them put two X's. I remember what this is. What is this? Well, let's find out. What's that other package over there? You also sent me this. It says Fox Thunder glare. Do not open yet. That's what it says. Dude, this is sent... Holy moly. Do you remember our failed history nugget project? I do. That was a great idea. We're sitting in a room right now for the benefit of the third chair. Surrounded by things you bought that you spent money on as an adult that you earned from your work to decorate this room so we could make history nugget. How many videos did we get done for that before we finally decided not to launch it? Zero. We got through zero and we were like, hey dude. Is it maybe this? Should we maybe not? I think we just got to a place where we're friends and we like being friends but entering into this weird business thing because a YouTube channel is different than a podcast. Yes. I don't know. I think we both just agreed without ever saying it. So I guess I'll say it. We just didn't want to do that together. No, I stopped wanting to shortly after we decided to. I did too. And the reason I wanted to is you're really good at internet. I kept looking at it and thinking, I really don't think I can make smarter everyday videos. And I didn't really want to make- This is really intimidating. I didn't want to make 10 minute Bible hour videos. No, I wouldn't want you to. I think you'd be just terrible at that. That was the thing. It was like, okay, you have your style. I have my style and they're going to have to somehow get similar and I just know. No, and here's what happened. We tried it and we flirted with it a little bit and what we discovered is if I try to just act like you and you're authentic, on camera, you's a lot like just you, you. But I'm not like on camera, you or you, you at all. Right. I know people think that we have a lot in common and I suppose we have a fair amount. I say we have a lot of brilliant business. But one of the big public funds on camera is the Access Hand Keyboard. I mean, the Access Hand is a lot like when you run a game as everybody runs. But at the time someone loves an e-mail or whatever. They tried to push people back during the demo, but the next thing she says is, it's a little external. So awful. Hey, you want to break up? Oh, please. I had a buddy. A buddy. His name is Chris. He took me to a Bama game at the University of Alabama game, and he has season tickets. And it's awesome. Like, he's got these great tickets. And he took me and my son one day with him and his son. He gave us two of his tickets. They have four. It's a big deal to have season tickets to Bama. Huge deal. And so he said he and his dad for a couple of years, they would go down to the Bama games and they would tailgate every game. That's a big deal. And the way it works is you have to be there by 7 a.m. You have 15 minutes to get all your stuff out onto the quad and set up and your grill and all this. And they had like, they had mastered it where they had, okay, I'm going to pull the truck up. It's 300 pounds, but two of us can do it. We drop it and then we kind of like ping one, walk it over there. Why do you only get 15 minutes? Because if you think about it, you've never been to a Bama game, have you? No, certainly not. We need to fix that. I went to a Colorado state game in Fort Collins this year with Adam. Adam and I were there and there were cheerleaders and there was a guy selling popcorn and they lost to Vanderbilt. Well, they never held an SCC. They're a sleeper. They're sleeping. That was their only win. Oh, was it really? Well, they're SCC team. They get beat up by everybody. However, the, this tailgate experience at Bama's amazing. And so he said that every day they'd wake up, every Saturday that the game was in test close, so they'd go there, set their, their, their big tailgate and thing up, do the whole game experience, go back out after the game, tear it all down, they'd get home at midnight. It was like awful. He said this was the hardest thing he'd ever done in their life. And he said the goal was to have fun and chill and like have a good experience. And he said Sunday morning, he would wake up and he felt like he worked an entire week again on Saturday. Yes. Yeah. Yes. That's how I felt when we bought a camper. Yeah, exactly. And that's how you felt when we tried to make history and I get to exactly two. And so he said one day he picks up his dad and he's like, Hey dad, I'm thinking about just not, you know, not doing the tailgate thing next year. But I mean, I'm so sad because I know you love it so much, dad. And you know, honestly, I've been, I've been doing this for you for another year because I know how much it means to you. And he said his dad is like, son, I hate this so much. I've been doing it for you. It's like, I thought you never say that. It is so great. So anyway, I'm holding a box that says Fox Thunderglare do not open yet. This was sent four years ago by the calendar and it's never been open. And I think the problem is I think I know what's in here, but I sent you two packages and I don't know which one this is. I'm going to throw this back to you. Okay. So you asked if I had a knife. This can I can I briefly advocate for this thing I'm about to show you? I'm ready. Okay. So what I'm seeing because we have the luxury of that because we're in person, what I'm seeing is something that looks like like a Scottish Dirk that you would slide into your sock when you are wearing your kilt and your formal wear. It's like a dagger kind of looking thing with a straight blade, straight dagger. It's got a yellow handle with a big open loop like a kitchen implement would have like a potato peeler would have that big loop so you can hang it up in the kitchen. And then the blade, if you will, is not a script. I can't I assume it's double edged. It's that kind of shape, but it looks almost more like a nail file and it's rounded. It's like an oyster shucker, doesn't it? I just do not understand oysters. So I don't know what you're I don't know. I can't speak to that. This is called a canary. All right. It's made in Japan. This is the only tool I have purchased in the last three years that I use almost every day and I paid $9 for it. Okay. This is not an ad, but I promise you if you purchase this canary knife, it is the best tool purchase you'll make this year. Oh. Okay. Now it doesn't look like anything, doesn't it? This is made in Japan. It looks like less than nothing. It's made in Japan. It's a blade. This is a nonstick blade. And what you can't see here, I can I can't cut myself with this. But it looks like seration. Is it not very, very tiny seration? So you go, I'm gonna throw it to you because I know you can't. Oh my God. You don't do that with knives. You don't, but it's a canary. It's different. That genuinely stressed me out. I know because you threw the box to me and what did I do is whatever caught it. Yeah. Look at that. Because I caught a billion things, but I don't catch a ton of knives and you threw it at me and I panicked. So that knife, let me just, before you do it, because I want you to experience it. You made a throwback. Yeah. Like the sideshow, like I'm on a big wheel on your spin. It won't stick in the wall, but that thing is excellent at cutting cardboard. It is designed specifically for cutting cardboard. Okay. So take your thumb and take it up near the top of the edge. It's rounded. It's blunt at the end. On that edge, there's just a couple of teeth up there. Mm hmm. I feel it. So those teeth will get into the box or in this case tape. You're about to cut tape with it. That I'm just telling you, go ahead and do it and just describe what's happening. You do it. All right. Well, what I've got here is one of those little USPS shipping boxes and it is very thoroughly taped by the sender. Wow. Yeah. That is a pretty easy. I don't know. That wasn't dazzling. You got to grab the edge. There's an edge to the serration. Like, oh, well, once I got it, once I found the edge, it went assertively. So what I found is it did not just punch through tape. Just cut the edge off of that. Like a knife would? No, no, you don't punch. You use that little bitty edge. Like just cut the edge off. Okay, right there. Now just cut straight down. Oh, yeah. You see what I'm saying? What? I know. This is like what when I was a kid, I imagined butter knives would do to cardboard. I know. But they didn't. But this does. This does. I could do this all day. Dude, this is. And then neat. That is incredible. Your techniques, your technique needs a little work, but you'll get there. That's my first time with a canary. I know. Oh, isn't that great? That's remarkable. How well that it is. It is. It's through it. Hashtag not an ad. Okay. So, you know what the best tool I buy is my favorite tool? What's that? It's that single pointy edged paint scraper, multi tool. It's got the big thick beefy handle. And then it's got it's like a putty knife, but it's a paint scraper. So it's got a sharp point on the one side and you can pull nails in it. It's got the opening for. Oh, yeah. It's like the seven and one. It's not a pry bar. It's this size. I mean, it has you grip it with one hand. But it's got the little thing where yeah, it's a it's a demolition tool. Like you have a little thing on the end where you hit it with a hammer. That's a nail. Yeah, strike. Well, I think of it as a. It's a paint multi tool. Yeah. That's what. Yeah. And I'm not sure if I can get it out of it. But I don't say that at the expense of the canary. It's remarkable. Can I unstuff this and see what's in the box? Are you ready? I'm very excited as well. Yeah. Are we making history, Nugget? No, we're not. No, we're not. No, not at all. Chief Consulate. So I do know that for a time there, I sent you some stuff and I was like, Oh, I'll give you this and you get to open it on camera because we thought we were going to do something like that, but we're not. And so the problem is I think I know what this is. And I think I've forgotten everything about it. Oh, well, I'm. Oh, what does it say? Interesting. What does it say? This isn't what I expected. So there's a white box here, like an old nondescript white, almost your real tebok. Take a picture of it. Take a picture of it. And what I'm here, let me hold it real quick. I'm going to take a picture and give it to the. Patrons. What? What? I don't know. I have no memory of this. Okay. I think this is just something the guy I bought it from. What did he do? 1960 SD sent. That's not what I thought it was. Okay. So I think what I sent you is in that box. That must have been him just being nice. Yeah. What does SD mean? I don't know. It's a penny. Yeah. Like it doesn't mean South Dakota. I didn't live in South Dakota when you sent this to me. No. So it's a little white box with a penny taped in like a coin holder on the outside. Yeah. And it says, thanks, Rick. It's cool. Thanks, Rick. So I bought it from Rick Canary. Canary time. Oh, it's just butter. All right. There's packing peanuts in here and. Oh, it is what I thought it was. I'm still not sure exactly what I'm looking at. I think I know. It looks like it's a brass. It looks like a sheriff star like that an old West sheriff would wear is a star with six points and there's an eagle coming right out the front like really protruding out the front. I mean, it looks like a pen or a metal like something would hang up the eagle in its beak is holding a little loop that you could hang something on. What is this? My problem is if I get this wrong and it's in that other thing, because I know something I bought one second. Let me Google for just a second. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to go on. Golly, man. My brain is weird. Well, this is like a history nugget within a history nugget. What do you mean? Well, the first level of history is that this is something really old that four years ago version of you thought I would find interesting. The second layer is that now we're doing history about ourselves from four years ago and trying to remember what we thought about things and what we imagined back then. The other would find interesting. This is two layers of history. Oh, dude. It's so fun because I know now and you don't. Okay. I want it to be in your head. Don't throw it to me. It's pointy. I know. Did that literally steg? It's got a gigantic. I mean, this isn't modern. It's dangerous. It's like a safety pin on the back. Right. I know it goes right into your flesh. What year do you think that was made? 1910. Before that. 1909. I would say probably 1892. Okay. So we're in the zip code. Am I supposed to deduce things from it being in 1892? Yes. Was this something that you could purchase at the 1893 Columbia Exposition in Chicago, Illinois and Jackson Park? No. Was it something that someone wore to that event? Yes. No way. Yes. This went to the fair? Yes. It's fair. That is badge number. Look on the back. What's the badge number? 353. That is police badge number 353 of the Columbia Guard. You have got to be kidding me. That's real. Holy mackerel. That is so cool. I know it's a it's a badge worn by the police officers at the 1893 Columbia Exposition. No way. No. Right. This thing saw all of this thing walked through the white city. Everything. This thing saw this thing saw the look on people's faces when they saw electric street lights for the first time in their lives. I know right. This thing rode the first ever Ferris wheel. You know that cop rode the Ferris wheel. You can't skip that. Yeah. I bet they kept it open after hours so that the people who worked there could get it. That's incredible. That thing saw all the fire hydrants freezing up and then piling up the horse maneuvering were on the fire hydrants so that they wouldn't freeze. This thing walked by H.H. Holmes. It did. I guarantee you. The first serial killer. Holmes was there. I mean he was at the fair all of that time. Like if this thing had eyes and a memory if this were a dash. It does have eyes. You could. It's got an eagle on it. So it's got a it's a six pointed star with the face of an eagle poking out. I mean it's a really I don't even know how they would make it. It's not cast is it? It's got to be cast. It has to be. It looks brass. Would you say brass brass? It's not tarnished. But it's got this little ring in the eagle's mouth like like a towel holder in your grandma's bathroom. Yes. Only it's really tiny. So what do you think goes from that? What do you think they? Well I think it was a badge number on the front. I think there was a ribbon that would have hung right here. I bet there was a second loop. This ring that's in the eagle's mouth. I mean obviously it's a ring and it's cast so you can bend it and open it like you can any ring on jewelry. But I don't think they did. I think the ring that they opened to mount the ribbon with their badge number. I think that was the ring attached to the the fabric to the little decorative badge. And that's obviously gone. I bet the officer who had it kept that or they got separated somehow. I think it's awesome. Dude. Isn't that cool? Put it on. I thought you'd never ask. No put it on right there on the the on the left chest thing there. It's got a kind of intimidating pin doesn't it? Yeah it was recently in the fleshy part of my palm. Thanks to your decision making. See I'm looking I'm looking up the old man. Oh that's so cool. It's cool. That is cool. Well here's what else is cool about it man. Is do you remember the replica of the statue of the Republic the big gold statue that we saw when we went to Jackson Park in Chicago and it's in the middle of a roundabout. I don't and there's the great big it looks like the Columbia movies statue at the beginning with the lady sort of like the statue of Liberty. Yeah it's that and it's all gold and that was in where was it was that in the middle of the lagoon of the 1893 World's Fair. I don't know I'm I don't have the same memory but I'm you're trying to confirm the memory with me but I don't have it so the point is stylistically. It all had this kind of look like this kind of gold this starburst kind of look. Design wise was throughout the whole fair like you go back and look at any of it and this kind of this like shining like the sun with optimism and brightness and glory and that's what this look is here. It smacks of it stylistically. This makes you that's crazy. Do you remember how I got about the the Pontius pilot coin. Yes, before we ever made a video about it or anything I told you I got this coin. I kept telling you I do this mean something to me it's weird how much it matters and it's just because it's a physical point of connection. It's like what the Catholics and Orthodox have with their relics like the idea even the possibility of a physical point of connection. It just the closest I'm ever going to get to tangibly experiencing what that was about. They put that on and they were proud to wear it and they were like hey you mean me. Well I mean because I feel that well over a hundred years ago someone put that on it's like hey they better know I'm in the Columbia Guard. You know you don't have a side. Yeah, I don't know I just thought it was really really cool. I'm trying to find another one and I can't but I'm certainly seeing a lot of pictures but I can't find another one for sale. And so I wish I could get back into my mind four years ago and realize that and just understand how I bought that who I bought it from. Can I see the packaging again does it say eBay. How did I do that? No there's no indication. Yes eBay eBay. Okay, let me let me go back into my my orders and man that would have been purchases. Golly okay so I'm scrolling back through all of my eBay purchases. A lot of a lot of film a lot of cameras that I'm looking looking at here. Man this was a long long time ago. I don't know how much I paid for it. I remember it being an investment. I remember thinking well I can justify this because we'll be able to make this thing together. Therefore I can justify buying it. Wow that didn't work out. But it was a really big deal in my mind to buy that for you and I was hoping it would have the meaning that it actually did for you. I feel bad for breaking up with you. You bought me a ring and everything. It literally is a ring isn't it. So that would have been what was the date on there. I'm watching it. It's clear on there it's shipped nine of eighteen. Okay eBay is not going to go back that far so we don't know how much I paid for that. Was it more or less than ten dollars. It was more. I want to say two hundred. I want to say two hundred but I remember thinking man this is actual history and Matt will love this. So some of my favorite actual history. I've told you before the time travel tokens. I have not changed on that answer. I would want to go and take a thing that for me is faith and make it sight by hanging around with Jesus of Nazareth and find out what the actual deal is there. Which I don't know whether that's a good idea or not. And I would want to go to the 1893 world Colombian exposition. That's what I'd use two of my three tokens on and I'd use my third token to write a deep saddening loss in my family. Wow. Those would be my three. That's awesome. That's crazy man. Well there you go. Golly that's so cool. You're gonna wear it every morning. I'm gonna wear it while I sleep. Why would I ever take this thing off? I like it man. I think it looks really cool. Can I see it? I want to look at the manufacturing. Do you mind taking it off so I can look at it? Oh not mind taking it off. Let me just remove that and oh you're gonna throw it at me. You know I'm not gonna throw it at you. That would be primitive and childish. Oh you just bent the pen out. Let me just let me just run it over to you. No please don't stab me. Please please. Oh Golly. It was genuine fear. Okay. Oh no no no it is not cast. This is stamped. This was done. Okay it was done in two parts. So the- You think that was stamped on the back? Yeah. Because of the ridges? Yeah well the star itself is pressed in a punch press. So that's how that was made. So they put a blank in there. They put it in the punch press and that trimmed off the edges. Yes. Well it does two things. They punch it and then they typically it's a die and they'll press it at the same time. The eagle is a different story. The eagle is very heavy and so I think the eagle is cast. Almost like it was sand cast. So it's but it's not a hand stamp. It's not like old coins. No no no this was- Have a die you put one on top of the other you bang it with a hammer. It's something like that. Die cast kind of thing. Yeah. This was- There was some effort put into the design and manufacture of this and it's a high quality thing and this was- It looks like it's- It might be steel. It may be steel and then coated in some kind of bronze or brass. It's not bronze because it would tarnish right? Man that's beautiful. Probably but it depends on how it was kept. It actually has. Okay and so those numbers on the back that three five three those look like they were put in. Have you ever seen the- You can buy a punch. It's like a punch but it's a number and you can like you can write things. So it looks like those were put in by hand. Yeah it's almost like the old Gutenberg press you slide in the little bits and then lock it into place. Yes it's like that only you hit it with a hammer. Pump you just a little tap. That's cool man. That's awesome. Please don't throw that me. I will not throw that. I'm just gonna put it right here. Okay. I wanna- I wanna- It has diseases from the 1890s on the back. Oh it does because somebody you know some wife woke up and like poked her husband on accident once she was getting it right. No. Arnold it is not aligned correctly. Let me straighten it up for you. Oh that's fun. That's beyond fun. I mean you could have given me a trillion guesses and I don't know that I would have got to that. That is so creative and so cool. That's one of my favorite things he has ever given me ever. Oh that's just just awesome. Well you're welcome. I was excited about it. This episode of No Dumb Questions is brought to you by Audible Destin. Why is Audible good? I listen to audiobooks all the time. Last night as a matter of fact I took my son to basketball practice and while he was at basketball practice I was like you know I'm just gonna kind of slip out here and go on a little walk for the Forrest Gump 500 but what I was actually doing is listening to my audiobook. I was walking true but I was listening to the second book of the Wing Feather Saga which is an amazing book. My Andrew Peterson that popped on when we were in your truck the other day and I heard just enough within like three sentences to be hooked and then you were like no no no no and you scrambled for it like it was something you wanted to hide from me and I was like what are you listening to man? And you're like no it's just a really good cliffhanger I don't want to root for you. Oh yeah if you had heard what happened in that moment it would have it would have upset you later. Okay yeah I don't want that. It's a big deal man I love the I love those books it's fantastic and Andrew Peterson he does a like a great job list he's narrating it himself. This is a book. It's amazing. I always respect that. Yeah so anyway Audible.com slash indieq Audible is just a part of my life it's a fantastic way to consume content to make yourself smarter on your drive on your walks on your runs whatever it is and I think we should acknowledge that this particular book that we're talking about the devil in the white city by Eric Larson that's where we listened to I mean we did a whole episode about this and we went to Chicago yeah to go and actually physically be in the place because we were so inspired by the contents of the audiobook that we when we did our review episode which was also sponsored by Audible we actually went to the place where it all happened and walked around with microphones into that episode that's really interesting I'm right I'm holding these things that we're talking about in this episode I don't know where we're putting this ad slot so I don't know like if we've already talked about opening them or not don't you ruin that but I mean they're amazing I mean I'm actually holding the things that I learned about from the book I it's fantastic man. Yeah so if you want to get the Audible and you should want to get the Audible this this is the kind of thing that it just makes sense to have this be a regular part of every day we're cooking with To Kill a Mockingbird right now that's the most recent download we have of an audiobook and we're going through that with the kids if you want that go to audible.com slash ndq or you can just text ndq to 500 500 and you'll get a little length it'll take the same place so you get a 30 day trial a free book and then access to the whole audible plus catalog that's all the stuff that's just in there that you can get without even using the credits each month so the offer the deal just keeps getting better from audible all the time and once again audible.com slash ndq or text ndq to 500 500 and you can get started on that 30 day free trial free book and the access to the library. This is the one thing I think that that I pay money for at this point that makes my mind grow like passively in the background the fact that I consume audiobooks makes me smarter and I enjoy that. Do I need to open another thing? Yeah I don't know I don't I have no recollection of sending you two things. Okay I remember sending you one. Do you think they're related? Think about what four years ago you would have done. Can I hold it? Yeah the other one? Here's the thing. Fox Thunderglare do not open yet this one's from Wisconsin. When did I send it same day? Same day. Where was that one mailed from? What state New York? This one's from Wisconsin. I did it on the same day. Day. Wisconsin is closer to the fair. It is. I mean my brain would have been in the same place. Okay get the I don't even know. Yeah get the canary see how the canary does on that. That's an envelope that's not a box. Yeah this is also an eBay purchase unboxings on podcast or off. This is the worst content ever. Okay there we go. All right. Okay ideally with the canary you don't have to actually oh you got an interesting look on your face. What is this? This is so interesting because I forgot what this is. Yeah it's a history and I got within a history nugget. Okay it's all taped in there. This is so be careful. Don't break. Very careful. I got to pull the tape off the side to find out what we're looking at. Okay it's in a card. No it's in paper. Oh I see what you got me. At this point you know and I don't. That's correct. I'm trying to kind of keep it that way for a minute. All right here's what I have in front of me. You know those machines you can put a penny in and crank the thing. Yeah and then it kicks you out a stupid little thing and it never really feels like it's that big a deal because yeah I don't know just go back to Mount Rushmore and get another one. Press pennies. It's a press penny. This is a press penny from the Colombian exposition. Shut up. It is. They did that there. They did. And you went and found me one. It's one sided. So the press penny doesn't get both sides. It just gets the one side. This was a bigger investment back then to do a pressed penny. Oh it was. Yeah you were given something up just for the material. 1893 Colombian exposition. That's all it says. That's it. Full stop. That's it. Oh dude so they've been doing press pennies for that long. I had no idea. But I mean the curvature is still there. Oh god it's shaped like a football just like a press penny you would get no picture. No this was it's just the words. Oh man. Arcing around the top of this football. Columbia got around the bottom exposition in the middle 1893. That's it. That's incredible. I can't see what kind of penny it is. Oh wait wait hold on. Oh there's words. 1893 United. United States of America. You can see the you can actually see the date of the penny. Oh it's this way. That's the way you read the penny. So you can still make out a little bit of the original. Yeah I think they call those Indian heads and the bottom. Yes you can make it out. Look at this. So that would have been pure copper. Turn that light on right there. Can you see it? It's really really difficult to see. Yeah it looks like they put the the Colombian exposition printing is on the the tail side. So that's the reverse. The obverse is what you can just barely make out here. Yeah I can I can see it just a little bit. That's so neat. What's your guess is to how this happened. Like what was the story of how this happened that day. It was clearly rolled. So it was somebody made a machine. I wonder if that was when pressed penny started. So many things started at the 1893. What is the world's first pressed penny. Don't finish out like what do you think happened. How did it happen. Um I would say a guy went to the fair. How long was the fair again. Is a whole better part of a year. Yeah. So I think a guy went to the fair with his family and I choose to believe it happened kind of like it happened in my family. So we go up and there's there's one child that really is fascinated by by pressed pennies. Well it's just the same press pennies were thing and he asked his dad. Hey can we can we get a press penny. And dad's like like just straight up damage money. Like a penny. How much would a penny have been back then would that be like a dollar. I mean we were still on a gold standard at that point. So I've seen that we're relative to the buying the purchasing power of a dollar when we went off the gold standard. It's like 90. It's like four cents to a dollar. So this would be worth a quarter. No, a few bucks four cents to a dollar. So the early part of the 20th century, a dollar would buy shut up. Stop. I don't care what you're saying anymore. Okay. I just googled for everything. World's first pressed penny. 1893 Columbia next according to multiple sources. The first documented press penny was made at the world's Colombian expedition in Chicago, Illinois from 1892 to 1893. That could be the first press penny in the history of pressed pennies. Think about that. It could think about that. I'm having trouble holding my horses. I feel like we're about to go down this whole road of talking about this thing. Not everybody knows what we're talking about though, because we can't expect that everybody's listened to the entire back catalog. So I'm very excited about the 1893 world Colombian exposition. If I describe it, I'm going to go too long and it's going to be overwhelming. So what is this thing we're talking about? What is this world's fair that I'm so excited about? Well, in Chicago in 1893, there was this big world's fair where all kinds of stuff came together. And I didn't know anything about it. You used to live in Chicago and you told me so much about it. And in the early days of the podcast, we actually did a couple of episodes. I'm googling it right now. It looks like episode 16. We actually went to Chicago and you showed me all the stuff. The White City where these huge buildings that were built, they're just massive structures. And so Chicago just really showed out. They were trying to outdo Paris. Yeah. It was really, really cool. And it was like this whole city was created for this fair. And what I think so cool about this is there were whole government organizations that were developed for this. There was this, you know, Olmstead was the, if I recall correctly, he was the landscape architect that did all this. I mean, Central Park in New York. Yeah. He's the guy. You have all these huge characters that made the White City happen. And it was this one moment where all the best and brightest of everything that existed came to this one place, Chicago, Illinois, where you used to live. Do you say the S in Illinois? Illinois. I don't say the S. Okay. Illinois. And so they brought it all together. And it was a real thing that happened in a real place. And you really care about it. And you have read a lot about it. And it looks like many years ago, I remember that I'm, you know, you just, yeah, you knew mattered to me. What I love about it, my quick sales pitch is everything you just said. But if you look at the grand scope of history, and you think about sort of the malaise about humanity and humanity's character, and how much you can trust where humanity's headed, the last 50, 70 years, maybe, maybe since the end of World War II, maybe since the bombs, it feels like we've been in more of a skeptical phase about where all of our progress is headed. But prior to that, people forget this, there was an optimism cycle where people were like, we're figuring things out. We're harnessing the forces of nature. We're experimenting with forces. We never even understood. And now we're not just understanding them, we're figuring out how to use them to make people's lives better and fix problems and improve things. We're going to solve government. We're going to solve crime. We're going to come together and be unified in all of these things. We're going to defeat evil. And we can rebuild the glory of the ancient past, with the Greeks and the Romans and the Persians, we can take all of the most brilliant things that up until right now, like the 1890s, we thought we'd never make our way back to. We've made our way back to it. But morally, we have the opportunity to do better than they did to learn the lessons that they weren't able to fully internalize. And we're getting another run at this thing. And now we have this technology and understanding of the natural world, and things are getting better. And so it was like in that moment, humanity wasn't quite yet to the point of dangerous hubris, but also was kind of to the point of seeing the potential and science and faith and reason and philosophy and all of these things kind of moving forward together. We were emerging from really stupid stuff that we screwed up socially as a people, just starting to even figure that out. And so what I love about it, the architecture, the homage to Rome and Greece and all of that, is that it was this hyper optimistic moment of saying like, we could all come together from all these different global cultures, we could put our heads together on things, we could like each other, and we can make something amazing, something unprecedented together. And then some really bad things happened in the 20th century. And so you and I were born into an era where there was a little more, I don't know where this is all headed. And so I just love that snapshot, I get why it couldn't last. But that's part of why this fair, I mean, what's a fair, really, it's a, it's an exposition. It's a here's all the different things we got cooking that we're working on. All of these ideas just popped right there. It was like this axial age of the late modern era, and it happened in Chicago, and you can still go see where it happened, and you can even see photographs of it. And so I, yes, I get really, really excited about it. But also, the first serial killer was there. Okay, yeah. And that's what Eric Larson was doing with the book Devil in the White City, is he's saying this was just a snapshot. It was a moment. And sort of the H.H. Holmes murder story going on behind it was sort of the yeah, this is nice that we thought we could do this, but human nature, this is why we can't totally have nice things either. And so yeah, I mean, you nailed it. Yeah, but look at it. Yeah, that's a point. And until like two seconds ago, all of that was something that I have seen grainy photographs of or heard things that people said about it or read things they wrote about it. Now I am holding it like right now I can feel the pointy's from the edges of this badge in my hand. Jingle that little ring in the and now you third chair are hearing part of the 1893 World Columbian Exposition. And as you hear that jingle, that's the little ring in the in the Eagles mount there. That's cool. Hang on just a second. Hey family, come here. Does your family like press pennies? Come here. You kiddo, come here. Look at this. Destin got me a present for a failed YouTube channel we never did because it was a stupid idea all along. What I'm seeing is Matt's lovely family walk into the room and look at him like he's a crazy man. Okay. And they're gathered around him. You bought a little book the other day. What was that for? The little booklet you just bought to collect pennies. What kind of pennies? One's with pictures on them. Like I don't know what they're calling. How do you make those kind of pennies by putting quarters in the machine and then you turn it and it crushes the penny. Yeah. And then one of the pennies look like boy. Um they're oval and fun. Yeah. How long do you think people been doing that? 1900s. Wrong. 1800. Okay. You're right. Yeah. I was at 1800s. The first time anybody ever did that was in 1893. So since it was in 1893, Camila, where do you think that was? Chicago World Fair. It was at the Chicago World Fair. And in my hand, I have the first ever pressed penny. That's awesome. Like it might not be the first one but it's the first time it happened. Look at that. Can you see what it says? That's awesome. I'm not going to let you put that in your book. Better not. Uncle Roy's Tarantula Ranch. M 1893 Columbia Exposition. Now those don't live next to each other. Isn't that amazing? That's amazing. All right. Now check this out. That right there is what the Colombian guard, the people who provided security for the Colombian exposition in Chicago. That's what they wore. That was their badge. Is that not just amazing? Here. Hold that. Here. Hold the press penny. You get told nothing. Oh, be careful. It's pointy in their diseases on there from generations ago. Yeah, there's still like typhus on there. Don't give your sister a typhus. Isn't that cool? So somebody, maybe from Chicago, maybe from somewhere else, rode the little train or got a ride or walked down the midway, the promenade. And they pay. I mean, it was like a penny to get in, wasn't it? I don't remember. I wasn't there. But you have been there. Oh, yeah. It was just it was closed at that point, right? I think so. So they pay their penny or whatever it cost to get in. And then they were like, oh, they saw this machine. They'd never seen anything like that before. And they walked over and probably one member of the party was like, uh, for idiots who've been wasting money on that. And the other one was like, I actually, I kind of like souvenir and they put that thing in there and they cranked the handle and those two drums rolled together and squished that penny out and had that label on there and they went home, they put it in a drawer and then somebody handed it off to somebody, handed it off to somebody. And then somebody was like, I bet that's worth a couple bucks. And they put it on eBay and they suck your dust and and buying it for me. They did. So what I'm reading here is there were four different designs and people could choose what coin they wanted to squish and they're called press pennies, squashed coins, elongated coins, rolled scents, pinched pennies and super near pennies and more names. Thank you for being excited with me. Speaking of pennies, do you ever see somewhere in time with Christopher Reeve? No. And Jane Seymour? No. It's a weirdly good show and it will make you feel things. It's a show or a movie. I use those terms interchangeably and it confuses people. I need to do better. It is a film, a motion picture from the early 80s. That's a young Christopher Reeve's. It's on Mackinac Island. Have you been to Mackinac Island up on the top end of Michigan? Nope. So where Huron and like Michigan come together, there's this tiny little straight, I think it's Mackinac Straits maybe. And then there's this island where there was a war of 1812 battle and there's a fort there and there are no cars allowed. It is a US highway that goes around the island but no vehicles allowed. So it's one of the only highways where it's only bicycle and foot traffic allowed. It's just magnificent. The water is crystal clear. You get that beautiful steam in the morning and it's a magnificent place. And in this somewhere in time show, this dude has this weird encounter with an old lady and he feels that she is somehow telling him to find her. And through a series of weird like early 1980s notions of new age, higher thought, mental acrobatics to travel through time and interdimension. Like he goes into some kind of meditative trance and he defeats time and he travels back in time to this Titanic era grand hotel on this unnamed island and he meets Jane Seymour and they fall in love and they have this whole life and romance together. And the whole deal is you can't reconnect with the modern times at all or you'll come back to this time. And without ruining it, it comes back to modern times. And there's a penny that factors heavily into the story and it all kind of comes back to that same moment in history. And it's what I like about the movie is there's just a couple little artifacts in the show that are evocative of a whole era, a whole moment, and holding that little item in your hand in a way could be said that it takes you there. And if you ever had one of those just amazing days with your family, maybe just you and Tara when you were early in the process of falling in love or a time when you were a kid, where you went somewhere and the concerns of the world weren't immediately present, you spent a few bucks to see something beautiful or experience something new. And it worked, it took you out of your moment and into another moment that you knew couldn't last. You kind of wished it could, but the fact that it couldn't is also what made that moment beautiful. And then there was some thing you took with you from that moment that was tangible. You paid for the picture or you bought a little souvenir or you picked up an interesting rock off of that beach. I don't know what, but have you ever had an item that just in some small way, when you touch it, it takes you back to how that little snapshot moment that is precious to you felt? Yes, you're sitting here in my house and I am surrounded by those things. Yes, I'm thinking of several right now at the top of my head right here. Yeah, I wasn't there, but that's how that penny makes me feel. So you have, you feel like you were there, but you weren't. Yeah. And so knowing that, you see that table behind you? Yes. You see all those pictures, like physical pictures, like their film negatives. Yeah, yeah. I need to show you those. That'll melt your brain. Are these pictures you took? No, some of them are those that you're pointing to right there. Yes, those are the ones I took. And you'll notice they're just kind of thrown in there with the rest of them as if it's just all the past. That's all memories right there. It's too much right now. Okay. Because I want to like make it a thing. Okay. Because we're rarely like physically with each other, but let's do that later. But for example, one thing I do is I grab rocks. There's this guy that used to work with me. His name was Norm. And one thing about my old job is I would go all over the place. And when I went places, it was normally in the desert or in a big open space, it was very natural looking like I've spent a lot of time in China, Lake, spent a lot of time in Dugway, spent a lot of time Aberdeen, Proving Ground, Maryland, just Mepin, Germany. I've spent a lot of time at different places. It's usually a wide open field where things could be shot, rockets could do things and all this stuff. And I started this because of Norm. Norm would on his shelf, back where he used to work, he had rocks and they looked very different. Some of them looked like obsidian, some of them looked like granite, feldspar, all different kinds of stuff. And he wrote on it in pencil, like just a rock and then like where it was captured, I captured where it was collected. It would have captured this rock harvested. Yeah. And he just had all these rocks on his desk there. And I saw that and I was like, okay, this is a man that's been working for 50 years. And he did that. I'm going to do that. That looks like something that a wise person does. I'm going to do that. And so I've been doing it. And that map that you see right there on the wall. The reason I purchased that is I'm in the process of doing it. And by process, I mean, many years of designing it mentally, but not actually doing it. This metallic sheet printed map. Yes, here. I want to build a little shelf around that with squares and then put a little circle sticker. Like, for example, let's say like Tulsa, Oklahoma, I love it. And then you put a little circle there in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And then like number 53. And then you have a little bitty cubbyhole, like the old printers, George, you know, and you put a rock in that cubbyhole from that location. And so that's a thing. Why rock? Because it's natural. I mean, also, I've seen a common thing that woodworkers do is they gather a piece of wood from every state and they'll make like a physical outline of the state out of that type of wood. Free cool. I love it. I'm sitting here thinking about what it would be like if can I put that back together? Because I always grab something, something I buy something or a piece of clothing that I was wearing gets ruined. And maybe I'll hang on to that. Like, I wonder if I can go back and build that back out over the last 20 years of travel. Because it's been an amazing 20 years of travel. Yeah, you got my wheel spinning. You were making a point. I'm sorry. You just got me excited. No, I've got a rock in the other room that I'm going to grab it. I know the exact rock. This episode of note on questions is brought to you by trade. This is what the thing says. And I find this to be really good language. I'm just going to read it. Fresh, sustainably sourced coffee delivered from the best roasters in the world at up to 30% off grocery store prices. Trade believes how coffee is sourced and roasted has a direct powerful impact on the taste in your cup and the lives of everyone involved. You've never actually tasted coffee though, right? No, no, at this point, no, I have not. But I eagerly anticipate doing so in this conversation, right? Let's don't get carried away. Coffee is important and you want to make sure that you do it right. So I'm just going to walk you up to tasting the coffee. I don't know how long it's going to take, but we'll figure that out. Okay. What's next? What do I need to know? I shipped you a box. Do you see the box? Yes, I have a big box full of things, miscellaneous items, I assume. I don't know. Open the big box and just pull out the first thing you have there. And let's just let's just take this slow. There's no reason to rush this, but I just need you to just understand at a deep level what we're doing here. All right. That ain't pin will never be the same. You do that too. You don't you got a knife. You always have a knife. Yeah, I do. I'm wearing pants. I'll Dundee. Okay. There's a bunch of stuff in here. I don't understand any of it. What do you want me to do? I sent you a grinder. Do you see a little grinder in there? Okay, I got it. It's a smaller box. I sent you some big boxes and some tiny, tiny boxes, but then there's like this medium sized box. Oh, okay. This says. Conical. Yeah, pull it out. Pull it out. That's what it says. Big box. Yeah, pull it out. This box is no joke. All right. I have it. What do you want me to do with the box? Okay. So ready to open it or am I not? No, no, no, dude, dude, dude, calm down, calm down. Okay. We're taking a coffee before. Okay. What I'm going to be like when I do if I'm this worked up without it. I know you probably don't know what this is like, but listen to this. You hear that? Coffee beans. That's all that is. That's coffee beans. Okay. So the problem with coffee beans is I think of it as a it's like a surface area game. So you take a coffee bean and it gets roasted, then it has to be chipped up in a way that we can go from like just the outer surface area of the coffee bean. And if you break it up really, really, finally, then the water that interacts with the coffee bean can maximize the amount of flavor that's pulled out of the bean. Does that make sense? All right. Yeah. Makes perfect sense. This is like the various biological media that I use in keeping fish. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. So so I think what we do is let's open that grinder. Let's just open that thing and check that out. Yeah. All right. I opened the thing. What like we do slide this thing out of here. Look at the robot. Yeah, just just kind of open it up. I mean, let's take this slow, Matt. I mean, this is coffee. Yeah. This is your first time we want to go easy. All right. Listen to the fump of the box. Let me put the mic on. I want you to hear the fump. I don't know if you could hear the fump, but I could kind of hear it here. All right. All right. Look at this thing. What are we looking at here? I got a kind of a skinny slender tall robot. I got a window that's open up here at the top where I can see where coffee beans would be. And then I got it looks like a little timer down below. Oh no. Okay. There's a dial that bisects the whole the whole tower. Yeah. It says fine medium course. It's got some numbers. It looks like I can adjust that for how grind. Well, let's do this. Just just kind of put it in front of you. And I want you to do this. I want you to put both hands on it. Like it's a crystal ball. And you're like, I don't know, you're like Gargamel. Adam, whatever. Madam Zelda. Oh, Gargafat's a good reference. Well, yeah. Yeah. And so put both hands on the top ball part and then just twist it back and forth left and right. You feel that? Okay. Yeah. No, hang on. I was just describing what I saw on the box. I didn't know you wanted me to actually open the inner workings of the box. That seems like a big commitment. Yeah. Okay. It's got a little scoopy spoon here as I open this. And then there's my little see through tower thing. Get out of there. Got to get this. So just like crystal ball style right on the side, grab that and it's rotate left and right. Feel that? Oh, yeah. What you're doing there is you're you're changing the distance between the grinder burr and the, you know, the whatever thing is holding the coffee bean. And so what that does is that allows you to grind up the coffee bean at different sizes, grain sizes, if you were to think of it as sand, the diameter of the grains of the coffee grounds would be different depending on where that is. Some people prefer a fine grind. Some people prefer more coarse. You know, I like to grind it up so it feels like a powder, like almost like that smart sand that the kids play with, you know. Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure. This is kind of the first step. And what we do with this is we take the coffee beans and we turn them into grounds. So you want me to do that now? I'll open up this bag from no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not, we're not there. No, you're not ready to grind beans or anything like that. But okay, so you want me to just reflect on it. Basically, it helps to close my eyes. Yeah, just plug it in. I just want to see what it sounds like. I mean, that's a long ways away from me. Hang on a minute. Let me see if I can make that happen for me up here. I got to undo the twisty tie. So this thing, dang it. All right, there we go. This thing says that it'll hold up to three quarters of a pound of beans. Yeah. How many beans do we get out of a bag here? Is that a pound? 12 ounces? Nobody gets 12 ounces. So okay. Yeah, I have no idea. But I don't need to solve this right now because you're going to solve it for me later. Okay. We're kind of out of time for today. But can we just like tell people what the deal is with with trade so they know what to do? Yeah, absolutely. I have a delicious smelling bag of coffee here in my right hand. It's called Angel Beebe's. I don't know what that means, but I ran through a test and gave my opinions about things that I think taste good. And they said, we think you might like this coffee. And so they sent it to me. And what probably next time I'll try it out and actually get to see how it tastes, right? We'll see how it goes. Here's the link though. Drinktrade.com slash indie queue. And that gets you 20 bucks off your first three bags at trade. Obviously you could tell I was reading that drinktrade.com slash indie queue. They'll like take you through this little quiz, figure out what you might like. And then they actually send you a bag of coffee from a local roaster or someone close to you that makes the kind of stuff they think you might like. I think it's good because I've been thinking a lot about the fact that we're shipping things from all over the world. And to me, it makes sense to ship things from closer like the whole supply chain getting smaller in diameter. If that makes any sense. I think that's smart. So also you get fresher coffee that way. So I think it's cool. Anyway, that's it. Thanks for supporting the podcast. Go to drinktrade.com slash indie queue. That gets you 20 bucks off your first three bags of trade. I can't wait to try this, buddy. Looking forward to next month. This rock. All right. What does it look like? It looks like a vein of some type of ore or other mineral running through the larger chunk of rock. Looks like a great rock to skip. Exactly. So okay, I got it right the second time. No, well, it's both. But the skipping rock. And so growing up here on the banks of the Tennessee River, you know, I'd go out to the river and you could always just you just knew the skipping rocks when you picked them up. Yes. And so I spent a lot of time grabbing a rock, feeling the weight of it, knowing how it felt. And so I was in San Juan Province, Argentina with my wife. We had just got down watching the total eclipse of the sun. It was just us in this big valley. We set up this thing and we saw the eclipse and it was a setting eclipse. It was awesome. We had brought a chair out there that we borrowed from the Airbnb guy that we I think I got bed bugs from that place. You know, he's like, he's not quite squalored, but this particular place was just kind of, you know, it was what it was. But we just saw the most beautiful setting total solar eclipse. It was just me and her when we went and then we went to Mendoza, Argentina. We had the best steak I've ever had in my life. You called me. Yeah, it was an amazing state. Anyway, long story short, I picked up this rock in that moment. And I think about this rock all the time. And I'm terrified because it looks there's this crack right through the middle of it. And it's got what looks like quartz, a vein of quartz. It runs right through some kind of sedimentary rock. And I'm just afraid it looks like shale cut in half by quartz. And I picked that up. I was like, I'm never going to get that home here. You can hold it. I'm never going to get that home in one piece. And money. Like, yeah, you'll chuck the pen at me. Oh, no, the rock. No. Yeah. And I got this one too. This one broke on the way home. But anyway, I just thought to myself, I was like, there's no way I'm going to get that home without it breaking. And it did break. See, this one was something I broke. I picked up the same day. And it broke on the way home. And so I have no idea how that one hasn't broken that cleaved in a very interesting way. Yeah, it did. Anyway, so that rock that you're holding takes me back. And so it means something to me. And when I'm dead, that rock's going to be on a shelf somewhere. It's going to be like, Oh, that's a rock. Cool. Whatever. Dad was weird, wasn't he? I think what I might want to do is start collecting those, grab them, keep them in one place. Maybe I'll label the bucket, skipping rocks, not skipping, skipping with a little posture. Posh trophy. Yeah, skipping rocks. And then what I explain to those who come after me is whatever the first generation is that I'm not alive to teach how to skip rocks. I want you to use this bucket of skipping rocks on the day that you teach that generation how to skip rocks. And that way I get to participate just a little bit. I picked the rocks. I can't show you how to do the throwing. I have opinions on that. Do you go like submarine, like real low arm close to the water? Yeah. Yes, I'm a forehand disc golfer. It's a generally speaking hammer throw for a couple seasons there. I played entirely overhand. Yeah, I'd throw it like an outfielder. Just run up. Dude, that's an amazing throw, by the way. I'm not good at it. Mine does this and comes back over and it ends up on a straight line with what I threw, but it just doesn't matter what's between me and the target. The danger is it'll roll if it hits wrong though. No danger. I throw an old school in Nova leopard. It's really heavy. I know the one and it just smacks into the ground and that's that doesn't roll. I figured out how to make that throw it at a different release angle. So I could throw it through tree tunnels and get it to skip off its back and roll over. Here's the downside of that hammer throw, man. Ow. Yeah, she's shoulder murder. I couldn't keep it up. But no, I'm a forehand thrower. So like a Dan Quizmbarry. Nobody knows he Dan Quizmbarry. I do. You're really? Yeah. I forget who he played for. The Toronto wasn't a city royals. Was it part of that 1985 championship team and stuff, boyhood dreams are made of. And so for me, what I just find is that's a really natural flick. I just did a TMBH video right through a disc golf hole that style worked. Maybe it worked better than I am. And so for me, it's really natural to just get down as low to the water as possible with that submarine delivery. And then the trick, the finger flick, I start by showing my knuckle to the water. And as I get there, it's a push. Like I'm, I go from showing at the back of my hand to like almost pushing my palm at the water as I release that. It's that, that spin that gets you 15 and 18 skips. Or if you just go flat and hard, you're gonna get five. Yeah, if you're the, if you were a bird's eye view looking down on you, you're a right-handed thrower. So the rock would spin clockwise top looking down. Correct. Which means that as it skips, it tails to my right. Yeah, exactly. And the more you can spin it, the more you get an angular momentum vector pointing straight up. And so you get the gyroscopic thing going on and the more it'll stay. It's on the board in there for a future video. Did you notice my posture just now? For a long, like, yeah, absolutely. You were tilting over to the side. That's what I do, dude. When I throw, when I hit a draw shot with my, my forehand, like a little slicey shot in tennis, or I drop down and throw that side arm disc golf or I skip rocks, I lower my right shoulder and cock my head because that's how I pick my, like, I sight up with my head at a 45 and I just realized I'm doing that for no good reason. I like skipping rocks. I like skipping rocks. Didn't we do an episode where we didn't skip rocks? Did that happen? Yeah. Oh, we recorded it here. We tried to. That's the one that we got. Everybody angry about. This is a welcome to the gun show episode. Oh, yeah. Where I think you basically argued for everyone should have a howitzer in mortars. Oh, yeah, exactly. Speaking of which, you're talking about objects. I'm within arm distance here. This is another physical object. This is a, uh, we call this a whiz wheel. This is an actual computer. That's an antichythra mechanism of sorts. Otherwise known as a nomograph. Is that an analog computer though? Yes, absolutely. You pull this thing out, say, hey, where's the enemy? Give me, give me a range to the enemy that not not that far somewhere between. Yeah, that's there 350 yards out 350 yards out. So I can say boom, 350 cool. Let's fire one charge and let's do it. The hang time is going to be 23 and a half seconds. And we're going to do that at 146 gunners. Melz. Cool. We can do it. Yeah. Nothing just tells you that just doesn't. Yeah. And then that corresponds with information on the mortar tube in terms of elevation and yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, 1460 mills. I'm sorry. Well, that is a disaster because that was an explosive. It's just really cool. And so that's a physical thing that I like to, I like to hang on to. Um, you know, I actually use that one, which was neat. That's, it's pretty cool stuff. Stuff takes you to a place. It does. Like in somewhere in time, like me getting this penny and this badge from you takes me to a place and, oh, okay. What I'm driving at with all of this, and I think you're getting it is I have these things that I tend to want to grab when there's just this moment and I, they sneak up on me. I don't even know what's happening. And the first time it happened was the first time I went to a tropical place, I went to Mexico with some friends and I was like, I'm an adult and I'm traveling with friends. And we saved up money to eat this nice meal and the food is great and the atmosphere is off the charts. Beautiful. And it's like we're in a jungle. I mean, there's a coral reef right over there. This is incredible. And I love these people and my heart was just so full in that moment and I sound ridiculous trying to explain it to you now. Because it's just a meal in a place where you can just buy a ticket and fly to. I get it. But for me, it was this perfect confluence of a whole bunch of different things that I was feeling about that moment in life and the people I was there with and optimism about everything that life and adulthood love could turn out to be. And so I just wanted something silly, but I just grabbed a little flower from the little island where we're at. I kept it with me for a long time. I'm sure I know where it is now. It's like when people rip up the turf after their team wins a baseball or football game. I just wanted some tangible thing from that instant, that moment of epiphany and of feeling that is beyond words. And since I couldn't put words to it, my impulse was maybe I could put stuff to it. And there could be something that could remind me of how I felt in that one little moment that I'll never feel again. I can go to that restaurant a hundred more times with the exact same people. I will never feel that again. There's something about that moment. And if I ever find that little flower that I picked and dried, maybe there's some tiny bit of connection to that irreplaceable thing that was real, but that I can't put words to. What I love about what you gave me is that it makes me feel that with a time and a place I'm jealous for and I feel nostalgia for. All I know about this is words other people wrote down who saw it. Documents, historians gathered some cruddy photographs from early in the era of photography. I have no business caring about this, but I do and I feel nostalgia for it. And I feel a thing for this particular world's fair that is very difficult for me to put into words. It was difficult for me to put into words the first time I told you about it and try to tell you why I love it. But this makes me feel like I the penny. The badge. It makes me feel like I have like I can grab onto that thing that I can't say with words. Isn't that weird? It's weird. That badge for some for some reason, like knowing that that badge is next level for me because I think I bought the penny as an afterthought, but that badge was what I was going for because like that commanded respect at that event, right? That was part of the order of the whole thing. Constable. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a pretty interesting thing. It's really cool. It still commands respect. Yeah. Like it looks ridiculous on the shirt I happen to be wearing. The yeah, the eagle's cool. The interesting thing about that badge is it's got that the light rays coming out from the middle. I bet that went with the whole design of the whole fair. It did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was trying to get you to remember that statue. That's how I was driving it. This is on brand for the whole fair. That's cool. Yeah. You know, for as long as we've been friends, you have made a real ongoing effort to try to understand my world. And I still look forward. I think forward is where all the things are. I care about forward. I think about forward. I just really care about back. And I care about back the older I get more and more because I'm about to become part of back. And I think this matters. I think my whole family matters. I think our little moment matters. I think the silly trips to the grocery store and is like, this is life. This is as life as what people will be doing 500 years from now is life. Those are humans pursuing something. Humans imbued with a certain nobility. Humans imbued with a certain frailty. Loved people and lost people and laughed about stuff and dreamt about things and were bored and entertained themselves and went to work. We get this little moment on the stage of history. And it's very hard for me to explain why it matters. And rather than just saying, that does not one and zero and engineer, I really made a tremendous effort to try to understand this curious quirk about your friend. This means a lot for that reason as well. It's a gesture of understanding. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome past Destin really, really nailed it. No, I'm just I'm making light of it. But no, that's I remember that badge and I remember thinking, man, what are we going to do this? And so the fact that you so the fact that you moved from Wyoming to South Dakota and you never opened the box and you get as pretty neat. Said do not open. Yeah. Fox Thunderglare. That's cool, man. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I really, I remember the night I bought that and I remember being super excited about it. And I'm glad it I'm glad it did the thing I was hoping it would do. But the point is, history nugget was stupid. And it's a good thing we never did that so stupid. So freaking stupid.
