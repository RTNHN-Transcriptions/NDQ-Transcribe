Those are all four in her Okay, keep going say you will say you won't make up your mind tonight You know that one I just got a text from the other room that says you sound like you have to rats I Never get a text from the other room what I'm recording. Okay, go ahead. You go it well Lou Graham and foreigner take exception to that. Uh, What do we at what are we at? That's like eight seven eight yeah seven or eight. Yeah, same number basically. All right, um Midnight blue do you know that one no Yeah, I think that's just Lou Graham. No, I don't know. Okay. I'm scrolling songs now and I'm thinking uh, okay Eight would eight's pretty good. They're getting a little more obscure. It's pretty good It's way more than you figure. Yeah, it's absolutely Hey speaking of old music. Yes. I have purchased a record player And what do you play on it a lot? Do you have a record player? I do have a record player. Do you really? Yeah, I do so I went to light blue thrift stores and antique shops Um, and I've got a lot of records now. I've got credence clear water revival. Oh, yeah, what songs are on it? Oh all of them proud mary, you know great vlog everything it's it's Bound down down down down down down down on the corner. Yeah, that's on there. But um, my son's favorite is the Clive Album that was didn't see that one coming. Oh with magic carpet ride on it. Oh, yeah Absolutely. Yeah, it's fantastic. So there's that and I've got some old I got an old nat king coal I've got a lot of like southern banjo music The the limelighters That kind of they all sound like the kingston trio that kind of stuff But um, yeah, it's just got a lot of really cool music and get this dude You can go to target targe and you can buy vinyl at target now. Did you know that? Yes, you can Yes, I did know that because I've seen it there. Yeah, I have not purchased any vinyl there I bought corn last iIbalt weezer. I just was can's as great as tits weezer. Which one what color is the album the blue one? Yeah, that's the one to get in the disc itself is blue. It's cool. Yeah, it's interesting I found the whole thing interesting and so I just bought it. Why do you like the record? Like I okay, so you're obviously into Technology that isn't right now right now and I assume this is part of yeah that movement That that movement that you're passing that you're having right now. Yeah, I'm having a habit to like it But what do you what do you like about the record player? Well, I can tell you what I don't like about the record player first of all I don't like the fact that When it finishes it doesn't I used to have one growing up that when it would get to the end of the record It would pick the needle up and place it back in the little you know hopper thing whatever it's called But right now I just play the whole album like I'll start the album and I'll just listen to the whole side And that's cool because it's like man It's effort to go, you know, pick a song and put it on the right track So I'm just gonna start the album and listen to it So that's interesting Um, and then the other thing is uh, I don't know. I just really like it. It's uh, it's fun It's very mechanical. You have to worry about things And it's a production. So what I've started doing is in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school I'll wake up pick up a record. We've probably got about 50 now I'll pick up a record. Whoa, seriously? Yeah, dude. I I found like the mother look you have a vinyl collection Well, it's it's like a vinyl one. I could buy 70 I know that's awesome. Yeah, no, that's great I found some uh some old stores And I I probably have spent well over 200 dollars on vinyl and a lot of those are just one $2 stuff But there's some great stuff in there, dude. There's Neil diamond. Oh, you know, you know what that means. Yes Hey that you'll marry me Sometimes carry me. Yeah Oh, what's the one that I was listening to? September morn We danced like something lovers in the night He's so dramatic And if anybody else sings it, it feels ridiculous, but when he does it it's like I just go to this place Oh, yeah, I know it's amazing And for everyone who are very young and sitting in the third chair right now to be clear All of these people were talking about wildly predate us They got oh, I did not grow up with like Neil diamond on the charts that that's not Even foreigner predates me But you know, I used to listen to it all because there was an oldie station 93.7 growing up and and I would go to the the garage and dad had a bunch of tools in the garage He had like really weird tools like shapers and lathes and just things that you know 12 year old boys shouldn't be Messing around with but I would go out there late at night and I would just build something Ridiculous and I would turn on the oldie station. I would listen to the beach boys. I would listen to whoever Don't know any of their names or I didn't and and I would I learned all of the oldies I went through a country phase and then I went through an oldies phase and then I went through a scofface And uh, by the way, I have not done with the scofface yet stop with this phase talk I do have five iron on vinyl by the way I that was part of their kickstarter So I got that and then what people can't see in that little shot of you in in the room with the clock and the Hanging rockets and everything is that you're wearing jinkos like nobody can tell that What's a jinko? What those are your giant bell bottom jeans with chains attached that have like 18 inch bell bottoms at the bottom that you dance to your scott music in when the cameras aren't rolling I know this about you. Okay. Cool. Yeah, whatever. No, I don't you never wore those You're a scott fan and you never wore the ridiculous jinko jeans I never you like the right age for it and everything I never did the try to fit in with anything thing like I can't remember getting on a fad I was like, oh, that's acceptable and I and I enjoy it. I will participate But i'm never like Oh, I gotta wear this shirt and do these things. I just kind of like oh, I like this art or I like this music I'm gonna participate. Yeah, I don't know It's weird. So you're going to like no fx shows and wearing like a short sleeve polo tucked in No, I just went to like uh five iron and Uh, oc super tones stuff like that So that's that's kind of what i listened to no effects is no, I never got into them. Okay fair enough My point is records are awesome And you do have a record player now you said so do you actually have it hooked up? Yeah, I mean we just play it through the speaker on the record player It's got a bluetooth connection so we can do it that way, but it feels wrong Like I I like just listening to the album on the record player with the crackling sound Yeah, it's really cool. I have a can of care. Oh dude. What feels like the first time Feels like the first time Yeah, that okay. We're at nine. That's nine. We'll come back to i'm gonna think of more. Okay. Sounds great. I'm done there mentally Yeah, that's interesting though Even to hear you talk about what the oldies station was playing when you were a kid That's what I remember oldies stations being like And now I don't I haven't listened to an oldie station a long time But i'm guessing it plays like fountains of wane and cold play at this point. It's time for me to tell you It's time for me to tell you something Okay, oh golly. I got a I wish I had a recording of it. So there is a station. There's there's a terrestrial radio station here in north alabama And We love it. I'm just gonna i'm just gonna out him right now. It's 105.7. Excuse me big country 105.7 wqa A country 105.7 No, okay, I can picture it No, no the thing is the guy that does the voice on there doesn't try to do the radio voice He just goes You're tuned to big country 105.7 w a qa h That's what he says. I mean he it's like his real voice And oh I listened to it with the kids and we love jerry clower. Have you ever heard of jerry clower? Is that like old school comedy country? Yes, it's amazing So jerry clower Has told some of the most amazing jokes you've ever heard and um if I were for example, have you ever heard about the the professor and the chauffeur? No Oh my goodness, dude This is so bad that i'm gonna i'm gonna insert a little of that right now. I don't know how i'm gonna do it I'm gonna insert a little of that right now so people can hear his voice Going down the four lane highway that chauffeur looked in the rear view mirror and he said professor What? So there ain't no fairness in this country My good man. Why would you make a statement like that? He said I can make that cotton picking speech as good as you can And i'm barely making a living of what y'all paying me and you getting rich He said sir, I want you to know that I got my bs degree. He said don't start all whomever you got all them things I ain't interested in them. I don't heard you make that speech once a day for eight months I don't memorize it. I'm a better speech maker than you are and I make the cotton picking speech better than you can Just that's up He said i'm fixing to go to a major university and they ain't never seen me They don't need to know what I look like You pull over to the roadside park up here. We are about the same size And we'll trade clothes and I'll break you from sucking eggs We'll put you up there on the stage and let you make the speech and I'll be the chauffeur and set out in the congregation And I'll watch you make a fool out of yourself. That suits me fine. That's changed clothes Now y'all get this picture. They drive up to the big major university The real professor with the blue surge suit on driving the big car The chauffeur sitting on the back seat with a little briefcase in his lap 22,000 people in the field house Standing room only the great phd what graduated from the great school of mind was coming to speak And they introduced him And just as he got up to speak there was the real professor sitting on the back row with the hard bell chauffeur's captain his lap peeping at him Now y'all talking about making a speech Who he forever more shelled down the corner He shoved it right on down to the car They thought that books in the air Wallet on the floor hollering give him a standing ovation Screamed And they finally got ordered restored and the president of the school got up and said Well, we have about 10 minutes before the bell rings. I wonder if y'all would like to ask this gentleman any questions So It's amazing like it's it's what's so clever about jerry clower is his delivery is Exceptional like he sounds like a country bumpkin, but he's doing things in the story That you don't realize he's doing like he's doubling down at certain times and he's allowing You to catch up to him and then he's outrunning you again. Just with his delivery It's just a very clever thing jerry clowers from mrs. Sippy and to hear him tell he's from east macomb mrs Sippy Down in amit county. That's where I saw the light of day for the first time, you know, it's just amazing and so I got my kids turned on to this by you know spotify We're listening to jerry clower and listen to all of them And they know all the stories and they they laugh and stuff like that And I was listening to the radio one day And I noticed that on big country 105.7 wqah they started playing jerry clower and I was like this is amazing I want this to continue and Driving down the road one day my youngest son and I saw a sign and it said, you know, this is the headquarters for the radio station I was like dude that is where wqah is let's go in And uh, we went in and I was like, you know what? I'm gonna run smarter everyday ads on this radio station Just what yeah, I know you do that yes, I do It makes it makes no sense No, it's strategically horrible But it's great, but it's awesome. Yeah, I know it's great. It's it's fantastic And so do you have the ad did you record the ad or did you have the guy do it? I did record the I took my kids in because we like to listen And they're like, okay. Well, um And what's so interesting is they're telling me like You know, hey, just so you know, I mean potentially tens of thousands of people are gonna hear this ad So whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what I mean Are you ready for that kind of thing? You know what i'm trying to say and so it's like That's why it makes no sense. I know you've got a youtube channel that's about to hit or just hit 10 million subscribers But it's and you're paying money to put it in front of 10,000 Classic country music listeners who surely don't want to go on the internet And watch engineering videos that you made no I think it's exactly what I want to do and I think it's hundreds of thousands of people that hear it At least let's put it this way the radio waves are broadcast to a listening area of you know a quarter million people And so this is okay But I've been one of those quarter million people for lots and lots and lots of weeks when I've been in the area And even though those radio waves were near me and passing by me I never tuned my radio to receive them or decode them. So I did not hear the ad So here's the interesting thing I walked into the radio station and I said I would like to speak to someone about what it looks like to run ads on this radio station And you're right. I don't need to run the ads But what I want to happen is I want this radio station to exist And I noticed you know a lot of stuff is just getting pushed out like You know records, you know, that's coming back All this stuff is coming back and and what's interesting about a radio station and being able to put ads on a radio station Is there's no algorithm in between me and the people that I want to reach There's nothing it's just like this, you know on this podcast One of the beautiful thing about podcasts is there's nothing in between us And people we get to reach and that's what's so beautiful about it But what's so interesting about the radio is it's live And you can't save it till later. It happened and it didn't so this is the way the conversation goes Often in my text messages, you know what? I'm just gonna find it My buddy john henry Was the last person to discover this and this is what's so funny about it is people will discover this and be like did did what I think Happened just happened and so john henry john henry says Just out of the blue haven't texted john henry in like a really really long time And he just said i'm glad to know smarter every day as a proud supporter of big country 105.7. That's awesome I just heard the commercial and I just replied best thing ever. He's like, yes, sir. It is and so like people people get it my uncle Said Destin I just want you to know I was in my tractor or in my truck whatever it was the other day and uh, I heard the commercial And I had to like dash to the volume knob to ramp it up to make sure it's what I thought it was Sure enough. It's you and your kid sitting there on 105.7. That's awesome. I was like, yeah, it's awesome so Anyway, I think it's the light. Do you intentionally have it run during what was his name jerry clower Yeah, did they do some kind of old classic country comedy hour? He's a guy who did like the the kundag skit right? Yes, he did and that's exactly what I did. I walked in I said I specifically want to sponsor jerry clower and the comedy on the radio station And and they look it turns out the lady the lady that's running it Um, she's my cousin. She's my dad's cousin and i'm like We're cousins You own this radio station and they're like yeah when the when the The dealership down the road when chevy closed the dealership my dad Strategically bought this radio station and we've been running the radio station ever since I was like man. This is that sounds like the plot of weird alz uhf. It's amazing. Wow It's so good. And so I walked in I said I would like to sponsor jerry clower on the radio station Do you have something for that and she pulls out the the run sheet? She's like no, we don't currently have an option for that But uh, we will create it And so that's what we do we have an agreement in place where they run smarter everyday ads on big country 105.7 wh And they run those ads and it's cool man. It's like twice a day. I mean the ad isn't anything Special in fact we just chose to do a station identifier in the ad like I took the kids up there We sat in front of the the microphone And I said can we just go can we just try something? They'll yeah, I said, okay Uh, come here little girl and she set my lap, you know my six-year-old and she goes This comedy classic is sponsored by smarter every day And you're listening to big country 105.7 wh You know It's adorable picture it that's not a good impression, but I can picture it Do you get a lot of comments over on smarter every day where people are like hey came here from wq I know, you know, I haven't seen that one yet You do now Uh, I haven't seen that one yet, but I it would make my day man Oh, well get get ready for it This comedy classic segment brought to you by smarter every day.

Well, and you don't just feel like you accomplish something you feel good because this food doesn't hurt Like so many of the things that you just pick up on the run that are trash They get hurts your body punishes you for doing it. This doesn't hurt you feel good after Do you remember the show iron chef? Have you ever seen that? Yeah, I remember it. Oh, yeah Yeah, there's one scene that sticks out in my head So it was like one of the first seasons or whatever It's like the only time I ever watched the thing And the deal is they have like three ingredients and they make the chefs make things with the ingredients And I remember the one the one show I saw they had like pineapple and you know, okay pineapple and it's like shallots or something like that And then in in the japanese style announcer voice he goes soft chill turtle And like there's smoke and strobe lights and this like aquarium rises up out of the floor And it's got these little soft chill turtles like trying to swim around an aquarium trying to escape What are you gonna do with the turtle? So I just did they do with the turtle. They made like some I don't know it was really good some kind of reduction or something I don't know even know what a reduction is but they reduced it. I understand what that word means But you sound really smart right now and i'm just gonna lean into it. I anyway I totally went off the rails there. However, the cool thing is you can like play iron chef at your house And you get stuff like harissa chickpeas and sweet potatoes and then you make these amazing meals It's it's fantastic. I highly recommend it. So anyway We should get back to like actually performing our duty here, which is tell people what the the whole offer is How do we do that? Did we already do this?

Hello fresh.com slash indi q14 promo code indi q14 that gets you 14 free mills including free shipping Thank you so much I was having conversations with A friend the other day and we were talking about what is a successful video on youtube now and We used to say oh, well, you know if it gets a It gets a million views that was my metric for you know while if it gets a million views then that ticks the box, right? To be clear I try real hard on youtube and I have one video that's done your former We hope it does this I mean a million views just that might sound like something that kind of cavalier to people who don't do this for a living Because you just see a lot of those that have a million views. That's hard That's a lot of people man It really is it really is and it's it's difficult to maintain a frame of reference and you and I have had discussions in the past like Oh, man, you know, you've said my video only got this and i'm like oh my bad your your video only got three college football stadiums full of people to Be exposed to those verses of the bible on the ten minute bible hour It's hard to understand understand scale, isn't it? It just doesn't compute. Yeah, it it is The whole thing messes with it, but you were making a different point and I hijacked it. You were saying yeah So early on you had a benchmark a threshold that you want to do achieve Yeah, and and I I realized that because algorithms are changing things that my metric has changed and my current metric is Did I enjoy making the video and did I learn things and did the people that I made the video with or for did it make them happy and Yeah, was it a good reflection of reality? And so I just got really excited because I saw that the james web space telescope twitter account Retweeted the video I did about the james web space telescope as well. They should but also awesome Yeah, it's really cool. And so my friend Said my new metric is If someone in my real life like a friend of mine or a family member if they text me and say hey I saw your latest video and I really enjoyed it It doesn't matter what the number is the bottom of the screen or anything like that. It's like, you know, I really enjoyed that It was great That's the new metric for him and I think me I suspect it's something similar to you as well What's your metric of success when you upload a video? Oh, man, my channel runs such a weird equation in terms of what i'm going for I don't know I don't know. I got all kinds of things that i'm going for For me right now it comes down to I am thinking about faith and life and family and big picture questions about history and why religious people sometimes don't get along with each other very well And I feel like if I make a little bit of internet that helps people understand each other better Whether it goes over great or not. I feel pretty good about it What's funny about my channel though is that I started the whole thing just doing Just sort of funny short videos about the bible And I still make those but you want to know how to guarantee that a video on the 10-minute bible hour is going to fail Make short videos about the bible That's exactly how to do it If I talk about the bible on my bible channel, nobody shows up It's really funny and not like oh, but it's only three stadiums. No, no, no, no It's like a it's like a potluck where I mean it's it's incredible How much that stands out from any other content that I make? I just made a video where my son and I went out and played catch and we talked about the values of jesos kingdom like that the poor in spirit are valuable and that the meek are valuable and that all the things that we don't want to be In the world as we think of it that there's there's value and care and compassion And importance to all of those things that we think of as lowly in the kingdom of god It's just it's bible 101 really basic stuff And we went out and we played catch through the whole thing me and the boy is 10 And it was Fantastic and maybe my favorite process for making a video ever and it made me think why don't I take him out and play catch with him Every single day. Oh, yeah, and also the bible stuff or whatever. So it's the worst performing video I've had on my channel in years And I totally don't care Yeah, I talked about something I super care about and my son was there and and we played catch the whole time and So I don't know man. I you get to a place where maybe you just kind of get done chasing that stuff And you're like, I mean I still hope people hang out and it's all it's always nice to have people around and feel like you're in a conversation on the internet But that's a lot of time staring at a black rectangle, too Yeah, and making stuff Being concerned with how many people want to stare at the black rectangle back is kind of exhausting Things that you find redemptive and making stuff that's fun That's awesome. Like I don't know if anybody's gonna like this video that I made a couple weeks ago But I got a hot tip that there was the remains of a church tower way out in the woods in the black hills way off the beaten path And that If I followed some directions, I could go out there and I could find this old church in an old ghost town mining town That's overgrown with trees And the tower I'd heard was still standing but that It's getting close to collapse because the roof broke in on the tower So I went back into the woods with my camera and my buddy and I found I found the ruins of the church And it was really fun. I walked around. I was like, okay. Well, let's workshop this church. Why did they build it this way? Why did it face that way? What kind of church was it? Oh, then that means they would have had this here and this here And then we found the space where another missing long gone church was and I found a local and they were like, no I was no evidence of anything. It's gone I was like, well, wait a minute What's this over here in this junk pile? And I found in the midst of a bunch of mining junk What is clearly the altar of an old school catholic church I just piled up there with like mine carts and stuff I don't know if anybody's gonna care about that stuff But it was a phenomenal day with golden aspen and a little bit of trout involved afterwards And it's just it's fun. It's like that's why I like making this stuff So Yeah, no I think I am kind of in the same place that you are in terms of what I'm going for and What makes it satisfying and fun and what the metrics are the the measurement is for Success on a thing. Yeah, it's it's like did it bring you joy And like does it feel honest and authentic? That's where I'm at And so I'll let all the people that are trying to be youtubers win the internet And I'll try to win my family. Yeah, so I just I just plugged in a sound design am fm electronic clock slash cassette recorder It looks like it was made from like Late 70s early 80s. I bought this somewhere for looks like I paid 30 for it. So I'm gonna find a bqah that okay Yeah, please. Yes I Can tell this is 105.7 because it's playing old country. Let's see if they do this station and denifier real quick My papa said son you're gonna drive me to drink it if you don't stop driving that hot ride Lincoln Okay, yeah, so they're mine. They're not gonna do the station denifier right now But it's a it's a fantastic station because it it just plays old music It just does what radio is supposed to do and um, it's fantastic and I enjoy it and that's why I run ads on it So um, yeah, just google wqah you can be able to listen online Old-time radio means something different than streaming on spotify It does spotify is great and everything but even the audio engineering on spotify It's a platform that's meant to be played on anything you can plug into So the compression is weird And it's because it needs to be a flexible medium We're getting used to a completely different sound in terms of how music hits our ears and what we consider normal for production Or is it feels to me at least like fm radio Had a different sound like the fullness of it the wideness of it It's hard to explain because i'm not an audio engineer But it feels different it means something different to tune in literally Tune in on a radio To something that is happening right now and to give up control of what song comes on next and to let someone else Manage that for you and decide what they would you know what they want to put in front of you next And then I guess the other question is How much does it matter? That that dj is live and in studio and making decisions based on how they feel about the day And where their head is at now it's all I mean dj's aren't in studio hardly at all for most radio stations You just program the entire day and it happens to the world But I mean, I was a kid listening to the radio There was someone in there and they were at the controls and they'd swing a microphone over and say stuff to me that was Live it was in the moment. I called in to radio stations a couple times. Oh, yeah, my heart was pounding. Oh, yeah Yeah, absolutely. And they're like, uh turn your radio down so you don't get the reverb thing I never made that mistake, but yes, I I heard I heard that happen several times Yeah, what was your local radio station growing up that you would listen to? Um 105.9 out of denderer and 107.9 out of fort collins They changed names enough that I don't remember all of it and then When I was a young man just out of college uh grand island, Nebraska had a station called hits 106 They had maybe an australian guy who was alive dj And I tell you what I would the locals call it hits one through six That that was the nickname because because they played just the same radio for Yeah, the same stew this is the story. I have a girl To find river. It's not the same. Oh, I hated it played rob thomas and lame early 2000s gutless pop All the time is that was kind of the end of my my romance with fm radio was hits one through six That's what's so interesting about that bqa ages you can listen for a week and you won't hear the same The same song twice. Maybe you do but I mean it's it's crazy When you called into the radio station when you were a kid, what song did you request? Oh, dude. I don't remember the songs are it depends on if it was my country phase Then it would be ricky van shelton. Um keep it between the lines Uh, oh, it's like a life lesson. It's like a dad. Yeah, it's it's one of those that has like each chorus Reframes the title of the song a little different with each chorus getting increasingly more serious and down to the level of the heart Exactly. Don't take the girl by timagra. Yeah, that that was the I think that was the best song at that I was really into stuff like that. I enjoyed those those things Yeah, I like that. I like that kind of thing too. We I remember one time we called in and I wanted to hear Man in the mirror by michael jackson I was the little kid my voice was higher than michael jackson's and I called in man I was terrified but they actually took my call and it used to be if you wanted to call and request something You just dial and dial and dial it's gonna be busy forever You got to be committed and we got a phone that had redial the button said redial Whoa, so I started using that and I just I just hit the redial button Do do do do do do and then I get the busy toner like I'm not but I just keep trying I forgot about the redial button It would just redial just like it said oh and then it was a verb picked up and it was like the dude Like whoever it was that you were on air. That was his voice in huh Yeah, like yeah. Yeah, thanks for calling hits whatever whatever you're in the air. What do you want to hear? Oh crap I'm not ready for this moment. I thought I was ready, but I'm not ready. Sir. I'm so sorry And then the way I said it it sounded like I said man in the moon I didn't but I just choked I knew the song was called man in the mirror, but I just like I I got the nervous Choke yeah thing yeah, and so he made fun of me for saying man in the moon. Oh, that's not what I said I'm just terrified and I'm I'm so very very young All those things that my health teacher said that I would start to notice Like my voice changing and hair and new places none of that's happened yet, sir I'm still waiting and I'm just so very very afraid. Please don't make fun of me on the radio Yeah, but he did. Oh, yeah, he sacrificed you right there on the altar of Right in front of everybody plunge the heart With you with his sword. That's amazing I radio for everybody else. I remember that stuff and it was you call in and uh, Did they do like the top 10 at 10 stuff? Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure. I don't remember like top 8 at 8 That's what it was in Fort Collins. Yeah, that's awesome Did they ever do the things on the radio stations that you listen to where they would Introduce a new song and they'd be like keep it or dump it call in it was this binary option You're either gonna keep this song on the playlist in circulation or yeah, it's terrible. We're making it go away Do you remember that? No, no, I don't remember that what they would do those and I'd hear a song and I would hate it And all you had to do then was you'd call in and you just press a button one or two And that would be like you want to keep it and to is dump it And I remember my mom heard me listening to that and I was like this Dumb dump it and I was picking up the phone to call in And I don't remember quite what she said, but it was something to be effective Somebody worked really hard on that That Somebody put a lot of their heart into that and this might be their only chance for their song to get played Maybe you should just not vote one way or the other and just see if it grows on you. Oh, come on mom Oh, I you agree with her. Oh I don't know if I agree with her if this song Was love and rockets so alive. I remember it that well I'm alive so alive and I still think it's just a terrible song And I I still believe in my first impulse to vote Dump it on that but mom intervened and they did not receive a vote for me one way or the other I still think about that sometimes There's some commenters on my youtube videos who I wish had moms like that. Oh, man. I have changed my policies on How I interact I don't know man. I'm more prone to block these days I don't know if that makes me bad person. Yeah, just just shadow band and done What what's your rationale? I mean, I'm more of the chuck yager camp these days. So I uh that hardened your heart what that man did to you it changed you No, well, basically well He blocked me because I asked him what kind of watch he wore and so I don't think that made sense I was like oh makes an interesting watch. What kind is it? I would prefer you to not Ask me questions about my watch and then he blocked me. So I recently uh tweeted something I said um learned to love your enemies And I've I've been subtly doing that kind of stuff lately where I just say like a truth that pushes back against all of Social media hate culture You know like love people do nice thing, you know, just basically you know what I'm doing here smart So what you're doing? Yeah, so I tweeted learn to love your enemies and it's amazing how many people Will like take their own time out of their life to go say no some people deserve to be hated They'll type that yeah with their fingers and hit send yeah, they'll do that Never having it occur to them that If you open the Pandora's box of hate like that in opposition to what you perceive as hate You and the people like you will inevitably end up on the receiving end of that at some point because all thought is fad Yeah, so here's here's one guy right now. I I'm just going to block him. He's blocked Are you doing it right now? It's done. It's already done. Yeah, it's gone. So it's like I won't miss him If you can take Something so pure like that and just be like hey love one another I tried that too love one another Can we agree to that? That's a pretty good idea It's the most apolitical thing ever love one another no some people deserve to not be loved And then I've just decided that's not a person. I want to speak into my life ever What a broken mentality though, dude. I know it is. I've got a sidebar about that. I what Complete and total lack of self-awareness. Well, me how much do you have to gerrymander? Your list of what makes someone Irredeemable and unlovable to make it twist and bend around everything you've ever done So that the only things that make someone irredeemable and unlovable are things that other people have done wrong But that you just happen to have not that's a dangerous person But here's the thing I love that person I love them and you should and I do and so it's and so the act of blocking them is not saying Oh, well, I don't like you so I'm drawing an absolute and you can never change It's me saying that's not good. I don't need to amplify that type of voice on my timeline Know what I mean? It's a hard one. Yeah. Yeah, and then as you talked about it more I started being like Righteous angers subsiding. I don't know man. Is it right to block them? Ah I don't know we talked about the pearls before swine thing like two conversations ago And I don't like being the one to go around labeling people dogs and swine in reference to that thing in Matthew seven but trolling is real And people who just want to see the world burn That's real And the casual destructiveness of the non vested That's real Some of it's earnest Some of it's not But I don't know this is kind of what I use it for sometimes I fish for the trolls So Sometimes I'll just throw a simple one out there and be like hey, there's there's nothing divisive about this Just something kind say something kind and but you mean it though, right? Like you're not just Yeah, people it's not a it's not a trick. You think the things you're tweeting, right? 100 percent. Yeah. Yeah 100 percent I don't know. It's just a it's just a change that I've noticed in my life. I've noticed that Huh, I've noticed that I've blocked people now Is that good? Is that bad? One of our friends that you know very well has told me the other day. He's like, you know, I've never actually deleted a comment I was like that's interesting. Mm-hmm. Huh So I have oh, yeah, I have to yeah, I certainly have It's an interesting thing and there was a really abrasive person on the internet who was doing like the super angry Christianity thing and they're kind of two versions of super angry Christianity one is the hardcore fundamentalist Traditionalist They got away. I mean they solved the code they figured out an infinite deity and time and space and they know how the things are And if you're not on board like here come the geortives and they're just not fun to be around And maybe they're right about a bunch of stuff. I'm sure they have redeeming qualities But man, it's it's tough to listen to but then you have the other kind of angry Christian Which has gone totally to the other version of fundamentalism the more modern fundamentalism with a different set of values and They feel entitled to say anything to anyone and burn people down as well because Though their righteousness is a completely different style of righteousness It's still inarguably immutably righteous and so they do their thing And those are the two crowds that give me the biggest fits man There's one gal who was in the ladder camp kind of the ag up burned by christianity I think the burning she took was a legitimate burning and she had a legitimate gripe I get it But it turned ugly. She got into a fight with her audience The whole blog thing because it was from a long time ago Turned really really septic and gross. I was like, okay, this used to be cute and fun Wow, am I out? But on the way out Yeah, I shot her a message. I was like This feels like it's consuming souls. Maybe including yours Softness might be advisable here. I feel the same anger you do I don't know if this is a good idea though And that's back when I was young and naive and the internet was young and naive and you thought that messages like that would accomplish anything And she shot me back a pretty good diatribe as I recall she published my note on the blog and Sicked people who were angry on me. She didn't enjoy super much, but I just disappeared at that point But one of the things she said about blocking people and deleting comments and all of that was Hey, I built this space for these purposes over this amount of time You read my thing and took 30 seconds and just came and like spouted off your stuff And I'm not gonna go with that. So what's the difference between her and me? Well At the basic level, I agree with her assertion in terms of time investment trying to build a thing Trying to build a tone and ethos of feel I guess where I disagree with her the most is just on the substance of what she was saying and what she was doing And so if you hear me wrestling here, it's because I am there's not a neat tidy conclusion to this line of thinking that I'm going through How sure am I of the boundaries that I'm trying to draw in order to To block somebody to delete a comment. Is it have to be just Really? Obviously this is stupid and destructive. Nobody benefits from this Or at times might my skin get a little bit thin And maybe I feel the impulse to delete a comment because it smacks too much of truth I don't know. I'm grappling with that as we talk Descent remind me of what your everyday carry is once again. Oh, it's uh, I mean a I didn't think I'd have this much fun doing. Yes, that's good And this episode of no dumb questions is brought to you by raycon raycon Why are you laughing? This episode of no dumb questions is sponsored by raycon who make fantastic earbuds that you can put in your ear holes And play music into your ear holes where they go right into the ear hole right into the ear holes and This episode of no dumb questions is brought to you by raycon destiny you doing this ad shirtless Uh, no, I have a t-shirt on I was taking my Oh, I thought you'd made it clear that we were gonna do this completely shirtless. No, no, I feel like an idiot now Can I can I just let the third chair? Okay, so we started this ad I said something on accident that was funny And then we started laughing and then we stopped a lot And then we we re-clapped Matt show them how we clap you do the clap thing. We'll do it Oh, yeah, we do this so that we can sync up the audio we go one two three four And then she lines that up because she's great She's great. She's a legend. Yeah, and so we did we did again Matt said something crazy and then we got to laugh and in the third time we were doing that. It's pretty funny It was the third time we were doing that we decided that it sounded like we weren't taking the sponsorship seriously And we're taking it very seriously because it's what you know, it's a big deal and So then we started laughing and got all sweaty and I said I had to take my shirt off and it I meant my sweatshirt And then man, I understand that. Yep. No, I I really thought you just met we were gonna do it shirtless to help with focus We're not so here I am So here's the sponsorship that we're gonna talk about it's raycon earbuds And uh, you can get some premium quality earbuds That are very reasonably priced by going to by raycon.com Slash in dq that's november delta quebec for notum questions and get 15 off your order Again, that's by raycon.com slash in dq to get 15 off your order and that's raycon Romeo alpha yankee charlie oscar november Matt I can fish like a madman forever with these things on I get through like an entire day of fishing and an entire audiobook And then I've still got juice left when I pop them back in the container because the container charges the earbuds And so they're just tiny I pop it in my pocket and then at any given time I can reclaim Moments in the in between times with stuff because I got those earbuds right there And I'm not driving everybody else crazily building the listening to stuff from the internet or an audiobook or music or whatever And on top of that I take them with me to stupid places where you shouldn't take anything And subject them to all sorts of abuse because of my outdoor hobbies And I just can't seem to break the things because they're well made so i'm a fan Oh, dude by the way, there was this uh, there's a guy named rodney that saw me at my son's baseball game And I had my raycons and he said hey man love the raycons. There's one thing you haven't told anybody about i was like, well What is it? He said awareness mode That's a thing have you heard of awareness mode? Uh, i've heard of the concept like where the sound passes through a little bit and you can engage with the world Exactly. I think it's i'm not really sure I think you hold down the button on the left earbud and it goes awareness mode and then you can hear stuff It's awesome. Anyway, rodney. Thank you for teaching me that had no idea how to do that It's really interesting when like people in 3d meat space Like say hey, you know that thing that you told me about on the sponsorship thing I actually got it and here's something you don't know about it. It's pretty cool Yeah, well and I like the idea of me being a little bit less in my own little bubble and a little bit more of a human out in planet earth That could have implications man Like wouldn't it be weird if that caught on and then all of a sudden when you see people with earbuds in That doesn't necessarily mean i'm on my own thing. It could mean like hey, we could still talk and stuff Yeah, that's pretty good I think the awareness thing is stroke of genius for what I do though because remember I wear this while I fish and there are bears where I fish Bears are big and lumbering but Theoretically even with earbuds in if I got the awareness mode thing going then you hear the bears coming which is better Than not hearing the bears coming awareness mode could save your life. That's a big deal Did you know that the newer ones also have sound profiles? No, you can get like the just the real clean real balanced Like not a lot of low-end kind of sound they call that pure mode and there's like a rock mode I don't remember the name just second. I think I have the name right here The balanced mode is what they call the stuff for rock and then like base mode if you want more of the The base elo and stuff. Yeah, you can switch mode in the in the early going Some people who liked a little more higher tones and mid tones for like ah man. That's a lot of base I get why people who love base would dig that but I like more the mid tone high tone stuff. Well, then now you get to pick That's awesome. Sweet. So thanks for supporting note of questions You can get these things by going to by raycon.com slash in dq And get 15 percent off your order and that supports the podcast and we're grateful And before that 15 percent is even figured in raycon's already started like half the price of other premium audio brands So they're a super good deal too. Yes speaking of raycon's let's get back to talking about music and stuff It's a brilliant idea And I'd just like to say that I'm very very sorry for the things that I did that disrupted our attempts at recording the spot Repeatedly before we get started. I forgive you and I also asked for your forgiveness. No The beauty of radio is that there's no comment section Mm-hmm You just listen to jared all that keeps flowing over the water. That's it man. Yeah over the waterfall. It goes you know what? What you just said is important It just flows over the waterfall. It happened and then it's gone There's something to that. I don't know if you meant minted at that level, but there's something to that I think I meant it at that level. Uh-huh. Yeah That's the problem today. There's not a waterfall that things can just fall off into oblivion It's all there. It stays it lives. It's part of your digital permanent record Maybe that's part of the romance that I still feel with radio thinking back on it Maybe easily at this point we can go down the same road that we really enjoy going down and that we're both wrestling through a lot Right now, which is all of that stuff the digital permanent record privacy all of them Now let's don't do the privacy thing Stay on the radio But but you see what i'm getting at like it connects right there, but I I want to stay on the positive In terms of just what I loved about radio and why I feel a romance with it It was like because everything was always going over the waterfall There was something very temporal about it. This isn't permanent. This is a moment Get that thing turned on whenever you can And it wasn't just like the DJ is gonna make a remark and that's what's happening in the moment It was also like this summer Is a moment the summer Of 1988 That's a moment. I remember where I was I remember what girl I thought was cute and who didn't like me back I remember going to the swimming pool in my grandparents place in rapid city that I drove you by on the phone a while back I remember going to estus park with my family. I remember a little ball cap that I wore that summer I remember all of it. I remember what bike I was riding that summer I remember what nintendo games I was playing that summer and I remember what music was on and what music would make me feel all of these different emotions and it was like the radio was the soundtrack to that summer and Maybe that's part of why I still feel a bit of nostalgia and sadness when the leaves change It's like that it is temporal. That's the end of that that era that magic american summer That I just experienced right there and you know following winter and everything else is fine too But I wonder if the radio and the temporal nature of it put that all into my dna I miss it. I miss life accompanied by fm radio I think it was a cool special thing that you can't really duplicate because Technology moves on and stuff means stuff and the medium is the message and fm radio was a medium that came with a packet of messages and meanings That you can't duplicate in other ways and there are things I like about spotify and how we do music now too I just I just miss that stuff if you were going to run ads For your youtube channel right now On a radio station what radio station would it be? Sirius xm's garth Garth brooks has a station that doesn't just play country. He's doing something there I think i'm reading between the lines properly and He's trying to connect people across different genres of music And I don't like all the music necessarily, but I like the idea So if we're going serious xm like stuff that people would still listen to in the car and tune channel so it kind of counts as radio I think I would go there. Hmm. If I were to do something terrestrial. I think I would just go with an am talk station like a local sports talk Or a gracious think about the state of the world talk. I was like date 50 k. O. A in denver I could pull that down from as far as mexico to canada I'd be traveling and it's the 50,000 watt blowtorch of the west 50,000 watts That like makes an aurora over the antenna Well, that's what they advertise and the broncos were playing one time when I was on the baja peninsula down by kabo And I went out to the car that night and I listened to the broncos game crystal clear on 850 k. O. A That's awesome to a broncos game in canada Listen to one in chicago, Illinois one time You know because they they would power down other frequencies at sunset or at a certain time And then the big ones could cover the whole country And so a station like that that I feel some nostalgia with then That at least last time I checked I kind of liked the way people talked and people thought The way it represents a local community and maybe something like that. What about you? I mean, I'm doing it wqah man. I think I don't know. I dare you to try it Double dog implicit in my question was if not w w qah. Am I saying it right? Uh, no, it's big country 105 point seven wq qah You kind of chew the words up as you say them Yeah, it's yeah, so if not they're aware Uh probably an npr station I really enjoy Some of the programming on there and the classical music in the afternoons Um, I can just remember like working because there's some radio stations you can play in the background as you're working on a report or thinking and stuff like that And there's some that you can't I also like all these stations The problem with npr is sometimes it gets too political and you know, it's got a leaning and I don't like that but Maybe an oldie station or something that just has well curated music One thing that find interesting about the record player is you've got albums And you know, this generation is starting to come to terms with the fact that hey, you know You buy an album for two songs and you have to listen to all the songs so You know, my kids are starting to see that but the the 45s. Do you have any 45 records? No, I don't I did it's like a single Yeah, I did when I was a kid. I inherited some from my cousins Uh, I saw people play them at the roller skating rink in makokita, Iowa When I where I lived when I was a little kid, they bought a bunch of 45s. That's all 45s, right? That's what you call it Yeah, 45s. It sounded like a firearm. So it kind of threw me off. I haven't said that term in a long time No, I know what you're talking about. Yeah, I found a an antique store Uh, where was it muscle not muscle shoals? molten Uh an antique store over there and I just walked in this dude had all kinds of records And um, I bought a bunch of records and I bought a cd of space ghost coast to coast So and so I exposed my chili a brack. Yeah, you know, you remember brack weird owl makes appearances on that program a lot I like that. Oh, yeah, I remember brack. Oh, yeah, it's awesome. That was a fun. That was a funny show legitimately funny Oh, well, it still is. Oh, it it it still works, man. It still works Hmm Dude, I please forgive me. I am going to have to go eat food and um I really enjoyed this and this is not what we planned on talking about. I'm sorry to hijack everything Who cares? Like this is the kind of stuff that Weirdly until you have a spontaneous conversation with a friend about it. You don't realize how much it makes you you I just connected the dots on why I feel this Romantic notion about summer and the sadness that comes with the end of summer That's built into me by fm radio and top 40 pop music kid culture and kid crushes All of it swirls together. I just don't think I'd ever really thought about how much Tuning into fm stations when I was a kid Shaped me. That's this is fun. It's interesting dude I just did the thing where you're I'm playing I'm fiddling with a little bottle of hand sanitizer on my desk that You know it's here from the beginning of the whatever And so I'm fiddling with that just taking hits from it I just did I just did that thing where I had a thought and my whole body stopped moving and My mouth opened just a little bit and I kind of gazed at the corner of the room. I was like, could that work? Could that could that? What if we ran ads for this podcast on a radio station? Is that sacrilege? Yes But that would yes that would take people away from the radio though. Would that be bad? Nobody just consumes radio or just consumes podcasts That people like stuff. No, it would it would diversify would broaden the interest of people. No, I think it's awesome Then if it doesn't work who cares because it's still awesome. I have a ridiculous idea What if we record an ad right now? Okay, and then anybody can just chop it out of this and run it on their local radio station if they want to Why would anyone do I have no idea But what if we did it? It's the dumbest idea ever. Okay, but no radio voice. Yeah, it's just gotta be real Okay. Yeah, we're not doing it like I don't want the The remote voice that the guys use when they're trying to sell you on balloons and hot dogs at the car dealership That's the worst thing ever. It just has to be normal voices So when I when I recorded the ad on wqa qa h I was like This comedy classic is spot sponsored by smarter every day We make educational content on the internet.

They don't actually sound like the podcast Oh Shouldn't people get like a sample of what happens?

So people know what this thing actually is us do this way Yep, you can listen to me verbally punching mat in the crotch at no dumb questions dot fm There I think we got a winner no no no Because you got to think about who's listening to it on the radio. It's like the farmer out on his tractor It's the you know the librarian this could play in a this that's something I think about this could play in a school library So you can't say crotch You can to say crotch Are you kidding? I don't want top 500 offensive words. That isn't even sniffing it. I I don't sniffing and crotch in this Yeah, I don't want to I don't want to say something that could you know, I'm thinking about little susie with her golden Hair and little ribbons in her hair. I don't want to say things like that in front of susie You know because you have to see it's not Because it's radio. Yeah, it goes to everybody. It goes to everybody. It's got to be super super super milk toast No one else is playing by those rules anymore, but I think it's nice What you're saying is nice? Yeah, I liked our first one, man.

Yeah, are you serious? Yes, that's how it is w k r p in No way Cincinnati. I did not know that Yeah, that's amazing. So so what are your radio stations out there? They all start with case like name one k away out of denver k h o w is like Sort of meaningless adult rock in the 80s and 90s. Wow, that's interesting. I didn't know that k i m n Was a station growing up k i s s everybody wanted that one. Oh, I can imagine FM Oh, yeah, huh the cubs play on w gn Like yeah, it's all I mean, maybe there's an exception here there. I've been pretty wgn's a tv station though Hmm. Yeah, but I think it's the same thing tv and radio. I think it's uh, yeah k h a s is a tv station out of Hastings Yeah, that's k h o l it's holdridge. Yeah, it checks out in Nebraska, too I think I think there are a couple of exceptions I think omaha maybe has a station that starts with the w and it's west of the Mississippi For the most part, that's how it breaks down. I literally have to go. I'm starving I used to go eat food and that's completely reasonable Thanks for talking about the radio. I don't know what we did there at the end I can't imagine anything fruitful or redemptive coming from it, but let's publish it anyway Yeah, let's publish it and then uh, so we have to give people rights to do it So feel free to use That that last segment there and if you would like to run and add on a local radio station do it We don't know why you'd want to do that.

Fm Awesome. Thanks for considering it Cool Um, I have no idea why am I would do that but if it works just once Uh, that's money going back into radio. That would be cool Dude, I think that's great. You know what's interesting is radio stations are kind of anti big tech Right now all the money is pouring into the big dogs, you know google amazon apple all that stuff And this radio station I walked in it was literally owned by my cousins didn't know it And so That's incredible So uh, I I kind of like the idea of putting money in the pockets of the the smaller people giving it a shot Yeah, me too And if it's with that dynamic ad presentation, we just put together that's all the better Yeah, or how about this? Tell us what you advertise on the radio like what your company is And I'd love to hear your ads. Maybe uh reach out to us. Let us listen to the ads that you released.
