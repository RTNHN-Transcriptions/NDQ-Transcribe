me i'm the two of us it's me it's very it's from yesterday i forgot how you're eating a day old cherry turnover and it's not just sandman really spicy like surprisingly spicy i think it's like you're with time good to see you buddy how are you doing we don't do one so often this is great you look incredibly handsome you've been working out or something i have not thank you for asking okay you've been working out your brain you look like you yeah i have been working out my brain you look like you're having a cherry turnover in your face so you look you look very thin fit this cherry turnover in my mouth it is man it's got vitamins and minerals it has what muscles and growing kids crave all right out of 10 moms would gladly give their shrieking kid that if they would shut up so we are going to have a discussion today about a topic you presented to me you know and i'm guessing we did different styles of research on this i'm guessing we did but research indeed happened because i did not know off the top of my head a proper list of all of the non water floods that have happened over the years and i asked what i want to talk about was weird flood events where weird things run into you that aren't water and do varying degrees of damage to the human body it got a little more bit the more i researched did you run into that as well yes it did so when i started researching i thought oh this will be fun we'll do one of those skits that we do with a barnacles and testicles skit where we're like oh i'm dying yeah we've got a lot of death yeah where we we go in there and then the more i started researching i'm like this isn't funny at all this this is not funny and i'm laughing but it's nervous laughing yeah i know right so i have some addition you sent me an initial list of the major non water flood events throughout history and i was like oh this is great i can talk about you know we do the thing that we love you talk about the history side i talk about the engineering side so i'm going to talk about viscosity and all the stuff and then i just started thinking more and more about how this stuff works and it's just i don't know i i kind of went down the rabbit hole how did you do the research initially and what made you first of all what made you want to do this you surely you watched like a video or something like what made you want to talk about this i didn't watch a video but i found the video what happened was i saw a pattern after a while i had learned about a flood we're going to discuss that was made of molasses in boston way back in the day i read about that when i was a kid and then i heard about a silly flood that happened in russia more recently that i'm not going to spoil because this one was brand new to me and i thought i wonder how many times people have been deluged by something that isn't water and so i went and looked i was like oh dang sure enough somebody already thought of this and other people had the question and there is a youtuber who made a pretty popular video on the subject it's like a little animated explainer video i think his name is sam o'nella i had not heard of him before the video was well researched it was pretty dang good and there are a handful in there some of some of those we're going to talk about here i guess we'll probably hit on all of those here but then i started going down the rabbit hole and then i started thinking well wait what counts as a flood is it just liquid right or are there other substances that could also count as a flood because the behavior is flood like the consequences are flood like the idea of a massive reservoir of something dangerous did you steal this idea from me because i sent this to you last night did we arrive at this because of the yeah the limnik stuff so no the limnik stuff i had never even heard of until you sent me that but i mean what what accounts for a non-water flood we got to define the term right and the research took me down that rabbit hole and that's how i decided we would need to talk about pompey because oh really isn't a volcanic eruption in in the style of what happened in pompey in the 70s ad in italy by napples isn't that really a flood it let me get the pyroclastic cloud i'm never sure i'm saying that quite right but all that ash and everything else it's like airborne magma in that yes it's ash but it resolitifies into something so it's hitting your lungs it reduces your ability to move sea orient and then it kills people it's kind of a flood yeah and i uh i researched one there's some lakes in africa that do this weird thing that we'll talk about well let's just this was your idea and and because of that you get to decide the structure all i ask is that you let me nerd out a little bit because i have did this is a fascinating topic and i went so far down the rabbit hole so how would you like to structure your topic that you've brought to the table the whole point is for you to nerd out the next three episodes that i have conceived of that we're going to do are all me sitting around and thinking about things it would be fun to hear you wrestle through so you nerding out is the point you just go crazy because it seems like a history topic but it ain't i think it's more of a physics topic with a dash of history mixed in so i'm pretty excited to just put them in front of you and see what happens but here's how i want to organize it when i started i wanted to go from least absurd with potential for comedy to most absurd for potential of comedy and i had all these like things in my head i'd be pretty funny to riff on that one people in there bombs like their babies oh gosh no no this isn't as funny as i thought right oh crap and so then i decided last night this is how i would like to organize it i would like to go from least consequential to just warm up to the idea like haha it made a big mess hope you had insurance suckers to holy crap the scale of death and destruction from this seemingly silly absurd fringe event is massive and world-changing for a huge community of people and probably needs to be handled a little bit more delicately even if it's in the distant past so i'd like to go least consequential to most what do you think about that i love it can i actually given that that's our structure least consequential to most i have a proposal for the final flood that we talk about today and i'm not going to reveal that to you yet but i i have something that's potentially going to happen in the future that we need to look out for and it could be the most devastating of all non-water floods ever and can we end the episode on that wait a second did you just do the art of the podcast hook where you get people to listen for the whole thing i've just felt like you weren't even trying and you just did that i found something last night in my research that i was like there's no way this is a thing and if it is a thing why are we not pouring an incredible amount of resources into fixing this right now so yeah i see what you go okay yep i like the order locked and loaded non-water floods here we go let's do it the least consequential non-water flood that i could find was the great brooklyn chocolate chocolate fudge fudge flood what of 1919 i don't know what you call it i just thought fudge would make it sound cooler 1919 like the same year as the uh isn't that the same year as the molasses flood yes it is so january of 1919 you've got the great molasses flood of boston which is too consequential to put on the front end of this list even though it sounds funny because things happened and people got hurt but nobody got hurt in the great fudge factory chocolate fudge swamp flood of 1919 i'm still working on the name did you ever did you ever play candy land it seems like there was a funny candy land swamper something like that absolutely it does or like a location in pilgrims progress by john john bunion where christian gets bogged down and can't figure out what to do next because he's insufferable so before you tell me about what happened because i actually i didn't find this one in my research um can i just have one little nugget that throw in here and that is viscosity are you familiar with viscosity i am because i remember a commercial from the late 80s or early 90s that was promoter oil and it said that this one kind of motor oil was better because it prevents it reduces thermal viscosity and prevents engine breakdown you got to buy the pens oil or whatever it was that's when i learned the word and back then google was called books so i went and found a book and i booked googled the word viscosity did you really i did i remember learning that i specifically remember learning the word but it's going to sound a lot more defining awesome when you say it because this is what you do so i would love to hear the correct understanding of what viscosity means well basically it's the resistance of a fluid to shear if i'm getting that right define viscosity and as i say it out loud i i'm like oh no am i getting that right so the state of being thick sticky and semi fluid inconsistency due to internal friction it has to do with the internal shear stress on fluid and and what's what's interesting is um engineers take whole classes on this stuff and so there's this class that a lot of engineers take called energy systems and what you do is you you learn how to move fluid around in pipes and you learn that a slow sweeping angle on the pipe is better it requires less energy or less power to pump the fluid through a slow sweeping arc than a like a hard 90 degree turn has to do with internal turbulence and friction on the pipes and things like that and uh interestingly uh i was interviewing way back in i guess it was 2001 at the university of alabama i was interviewing for a an internship position at mckie foods in college dale tennessee and at mckie foods um they are the fact they're the company that makes little debbie snack cakes and it was absolutely the most interesting interview i've ever been in they uh you walk in the room and you've got these like snack cake engineers in front of you and they're asking you questions about things you've done and stuff like that and at some point in the interview this one guy that's kind of quiet in the corner he takes this little piece of paper and he pushes over in front of you and he says uh mr. sandlin um i i'm excited that you're interested in working with us at mckie foods would you please tell me and you look down and you're like taking it all in because you're in interview mode right there's a huge piping diagram and then there's got like this nozzle that's drizzling cake batter onto this conveyor belt and you've got like motors moving the conveyor belt and you've got pumps pumping the the cake batter he said mr. sandlin how would you go about finding the correct horsepower required for this pump that's pumping this cake batter and i looked at that and i was like whoa that is amazing and so can i take a run at answering that yeah sure go ahead okay i'd come in on a sunday when the whole line is shut down right and i go over to the lever that says cake batter horsepower pumper yeah and i would start everything up just me right nobody knows i'm in there and then i would set it to a thing and then i would see how it did and if it sucked i'd run back real quick and change it and then i'd go look again and see if it was better and i'd do that until it seemed like that's how that cake batter ought to be coming out was that your answer no but but you bring up a really really good point how do you know how to do things in the engineering world before it's been done yes so i mean in i know that you're smart and you led me into that answer because that's going to factor into these non-water floods and uh i interrupted you i want to hear the end of the interview story though okay so the thing that happened in this interview was amazing because i just like literally walked out of the class where i was sizing this piping diagram so basically i looked at the guy and i said well that's a very interesting question john or whatever his name was i said well i would start by measuring the lengths of all the pipes and i would need to know the diameter of every single piece of piping in the cake batter flow path i would need to know the different angles and teas and sweeps and the the energy loss factors for each one of these and i would need to know the the orifice size at the end and the flow rate of course and uh the pressure at which we'd like to pump the cake batter and and if i was giving all that information and then i just kind of like said this is the equation i would use and you know it's like bernoulli systems kind of thing this is the equations i would use and and then that's how i would pump you know i would size the pump and he goes very good answer mr. Santa so thank you very much and i was thinking to myself thank the lord i just got out of that class and then the next guy goes um yeah okay well let's move on to the next question i said no no no wait one more thing john i would need to know the kinematic viscosity of the cake batter okay now we can go on it was it was like those nerd moments that you live for right so it was really interesting because i had never thought about the viscosity of a food product mattering and i think that's going to factor into some of the stuff we do today right i see what you did there and they've mattered right because matter is different than tears there are two different things that come out of your eyes but they both have different viscosity what's in the point being that everybody in the world knows that this is a thing whether they saw that motor oil commercial when they were a kid and went and booked google did or not everybody knows that not all the fluids not even all the fluids your body makes work the same way they don't and and i never would have thought to associate that with internal friction or i think sheer was the word that you used that's next level stuff and i know that everywhere there are jillion engineers who are high-fiving because you're speaking their language right now but intuitively and i know i use that word a lot when we talk about your field all of these things check out you discover pretty early on as a kid experimenting with the world that this fluid moves different than this fluid at some point you realize that if you mix together some corn starch and water you get a thing that is barely a fluid and you figure out that ah that's the far end of the viscosity spectrum though you wouldn't use that language look at where it is if i push hard i can't get into that so semi fluid but if i go easy it just absorbs my hands like quicksand that's crazy and then i assume water is the least viscous is mercury less viscous than water and mercury is weird now water moves and water is the other the least viscous i don't know what it is but it's not water yeah okay yeah it's probably it's probably something like liquid helium or something i don't know yeah so okay but water has that surface tension factor where you can fill a glass carefully higher than the top of the glass are we talking about the same thing there does a viscosity affect surface tension or these totally different categories i totally got close it helium has a very very low viscosity that was a lucky guess no no looks like hydrogen wins so yeah big job hydrogen so reliable makes really a lot of sense actually anyway go ahead i'm sorry you're taking this to the fudge flood right i am taking us to the fudge flood but i'm i want us to understand the parameters before we get into this i think it's going to make it more fun for me and everybody and so my question is surface tension is that an expression is that relative to viscosity or is that a completely different physical phenomenon yeah it's they're related for sure um they are related i can't tell you how but imagine um it also temperatures in there too so imagine a jar of honey oh my thing i saw your thing that was going to be my next idiot lamin observation but you're right on it yeah temperature of course temperature does matter tell me what about the surface tension thing imagine honey and we you know put a fork down into honey and we pull it out and you can drizzle the honey off now do the same thing with hot honey you intuitively know what's going to happen it's going to behave differently but i do the same thing with tap water what do you mean well i mean it just it just doesn't work so if you go cold water hot water either way that dip it just doesn't do anything yeah so you can be so far down on the visat on the viscosity scale that the eye cannot really observe the differences unless they're very dramatic temperature changes yes whereas something else 10 degrees with honey is going to change everything about how it goes yes yeah yeah and and imagine trying to quantify this stuff like imagine how would you quantify viscosity and there are ways to do it you know you can you can drop a ball like you can drop a sphere into a tube of liquid and watch how long it takes it to drip down you can put a disc into some liquid and spin the disc and figure out the horsepower it takes to do that there's a ton of different methods to do that but oh the reason this stuff factors into this what we're talking about is in these non-water floods when people get in the liquid it behaves differently yes and and so you know we'll see in some of these where people end end up getting stuck but take me to the happy place take me to a happy fudge flood yeah where everybody just ate their way out and everyone laughed and willy wonka was over like on a cliff just laughing in a happy way with everyone what happened in brooklyn my pleasure there was a company called the rockwood end company that made chocolate i think eventually this company evolved into one that made tootsie rolls for a while i think the tootsie roll brand is bounced between a couple of different parent companies but at this point they had uh had a factory complex that they had built and the shipping department caught fire one morning in the very early morning just after midnight and as a result the fire got into some chemicals or something else and there was a big giant explosion and the building took a whole bunch of abuse i think the building ended up having to be i mean to be torn down and then what happened was a firefighter showed up on the scene to try to combat the thing and they were like what what the heck actually is this that's oozing out of this building i don't know what's stored in there well it turns out that it's a mixture of molten chocolate and butter like ready to go ready to eat and it would have been in a more viscous state but obviously the the change in temperature liquefied the stuff and buttermilk's pretty easy and so it just mingled together and flowed down the streets as a chocolate river it filled up the storm drains so water and other pollutants weren't getting into the chocolate it was just a surface layer of chocolate everywhere and the story goes that a whole bunch of kids ran out and started scooping it up with their hands and gobbling it up like greedy little nineteen teens gremlins who just never ever ever got to swim in a chocolate river ever and they seized on the opportunity to get to live out that childhood dream but it didn't last very long they they ran off the kids they put off the fire and i don't think they were able to salvage the building that's the story nobody died nobody had heard people just ate chocolate out of the street i'm seeing some uh some i just googled it and i'm seeing some old at or not ads like uh i guess articles and papers gutters run fudge urchins run miles to chocolate fire i don't know what that means what is urchins what that means is that somebody was a great writer that's a that's a headline for the ages urchins that's pretty amazing so my question would be um that the chocolate was it hot like could it actually hurt people because at a certain temperature have you ever got like a hot liquid on you you're like wow wow and it's not a big deal if it's you know just water and you can wipe it off real quick but if it's hot glue oh my goodness if you're having wax or hot glue on your on your hand right there yes every year when i would start to get bored during the candlelight service on christmas eve me and my buddy is starting at about age like nine would be like hmm how far do you have to let the wax drip from this candle before it hurts when it hits your skin as we gradually figured out like uh if you're a couple inches away that's gonna hurt but if you're 10 inches away and drip it on the back of your other hand that's just enough time in flight for it to cool to the point where it's mildly uncomfortable but not painful so yeah i've done that math that's amazing i like that that's that's pretty awesome sweet okay so that was the 1919 okay here's another thing i would like to ask on all of these things i want to know what day of the week each of these floods occurred on i don't know why that's important to me but it is important yeah what what day was this okay i can solve that right now give me a sec i think the date in this case factors into how everything worked out because nobody had been at the factory if it was a normal work week since friday this occurred at one in the morning just after sunday wrapped up and just into very very early monday morning oh wow which seems like it would be a likely time for these kind of events to happen you've got minimal supervision and apparently the urchins stayed up real late back then just in case of a fudge flood so it happened like one a.m well basically monday morning at one a.m yep that's awesome okay cool i don't know why it's important to me to know the date of the week but i i just want to know that's interesting perhaps a pattern will emerge maybe it will that'd be interesting this episode of notable questions is brought to you by audible audible is uh an audiobook platform that is expanded into a whole bunch of other things as well we've been talking about audible forever because we love it and we use it all the time deston what are you listening to right now well i'm continuing to listen to backyard starship but i want to tell you something else that's going on that audible has been pivotal in helping me navigate this so are you familiar with the audiobooks i listened to a while back the wing feather saga by andrew peterson yeah i got kids charging through that without me right now okay well let me just tell you you're missing out but i was recently invited to a black tie event which i've never been invited to a black tie event but it is a release for the wing feather saga they're doing some type of little thing with wing feather saga and my son and i we've listened to these audiobooks and um so i just love talking about the kingdom of an era and arthampe wing feather the throne word is a king what okay is this the is this the story that starts out with a kid laying in bed and there's like a rhyme about a black carriage and a river kind of and like okay yeah i yeah that's what they're listening to all right i've heard this yeah i think my kid did a reading for an audition for a play or something so just before we go any further you're telling me i should pump the breaks on their progress and jump in with them on this it's amazing dude i mean you can let them get out ahead that was a little bit fun so so he was out you know there's four stories in the wing feather saga and he was out ahead of me and so i would just let him get a little farther ahead of me and then i would power through the the audiobooks after and that way he would be in the driver's seat and um i could come back in say oh my goodness i just got to this part he's like i know dad can you believe this happened and so i just let him be in control and so anyway when i get this this invitation to this black tie thing up in Nashville i said well i've got to take my son and so i i asked Tara i was like well i just got invited to this what do you think she said oh without a doubt you two need to go and so we went and we got a little suit picked out by the way you can get really good deals at belk and um so we went and got him you know fitted up for his suit and got it tailored and stuff like that and uh we're gonna go and it's very exciting and i'm grateful to audible for allowing me to power through these audiobooks and have this experience with my son yeah brilliant what do you listen to right now my family is using the heck out of our audible membership right now we're deep into the audible originals expanded catalog they've got just

that really cool indie film adaptation of that that story last year that was pretty rad that tale of two cities north and south crime and punishment cantorbury tales weathering heights really sire van frank that's the stuff that's on my kids reading or as it is listening list for the semester of school and i just love what my audible library looks like right now because it's all time tested amazing content and my kids are consuming it oh yeah it's same i'm looking through mine i've got all kinds of stuff that's oh i'm sorry i've got your audiobook here Persian fire i still need to listen to that i will do that yeah all do that because i want i'm letting you get out of head matt okay so uh 20 000 leagues under the sea oh yeah my goodness it's all so good so what's the offer here for the third

of people died and so i i think some of mine will be towards the end there's only really two or three that i that i have to bring to the table here okay uh man my next one kills 13 people that's a few too many i think we got to go with the pepsi fruit juice flood of lesbian russia next that is a sentence that your brain just put together okay that's good all right so all right homie april 25th 2017 you can start looking up what day of the week that is right now because i'm curious april 25th so this is recent history 2017 yes okay i didn't know this is it happened april 25th 2017 that was a Tuesday okay naturally oh two days in russia i think you know what they say i don't watch for the fruit juice watch for the fruit juice explosion this one's pretty straightforward though the initiating event of the pepsi fruit juice flood of 2017 of lebde and russia the initiating event is not well known for some reason the roof of a warehouse collapsed that may just be russian construction oh but it was in the the middle of town i don't know really anything about this town in terms of its size maybe we should know that real quick about 20 000 people live in this city okay so not huge in the middle of town this warehouse roof caves in and unfortunately there were a couple of people in there when it collapsed but i guess they saw it coming because they only had a couple of minor injuries they did not die in the collapse but what happened was yet all of this fruit juice and vegetable juice some of which apparently was already in consumable form other containers where i probably meant to be repurposed into a more popularized or marketable version of the beverage but they just opened up everywhere and the streets ran red with pepsi co fruit and vegetable juice so so hold on were these like vats of juice or were they just like a bunch of containers spilled okay it looks like there were varying sizes of containers but it was a warehouse so it wasn't a production facility meaning i don't think they would have had that i mean maybe maybe drums would have been the biggest size i don't have that in front of me but that's what i seem to recall so when the collapse happened effectively just all of these containers that were ready for shipping or distribution even just got squished and out came everything 7.4 million gallons is the estimate of how much of this sticky juicy goo would have flowed now viscosity wise what's going to be the difference between your basic popular consumer fruit juice and water i don't know but it's not a lot but what i do know is every time i've ever spilled juice it is sticky and it's a mess and i do not like to end up and it's like sugar and flies and it's not a great deal is it was that the deal here no i imagine this would have been like if a billion kids who just ate cheetos and fruit roll-ups and are four years old just went and touched everything everything i used to have fish tanks who select to keep the fish and inevitably our friends kids would come over and mom would be like here you go little teddy why don't you have nine fruit roll-ups and the kid would eat the fruit roll-ups and you have a whole fruit roll-up mustache and his hands would just be covered in fruit roll-ups slime and i'd be like that kid he's gonna go touch the fish tank and he's gonna touch the tv he's gonna do it and he's gonna touch him a lot and what do you do do you tell this poor young mom who's getting her butt handed to her by the pressures of motherhood hey clean your kids hands i don't want him to touch my stuff or do you just clean it later well now you just clean it later but wow if it made that big of a mess of my aquarium and my tv and that probably wasn't 7.4 million gallons on that kid's hands i just shudder to think how much of a mess this probably made that's a good point i wonder if have you ever left a cup of juice or something out or even like a soft drink it slowly starts to evaporate and it gets nastier and nastier and eventually you get this state that's kind of like fruit roll-up it's kind of at the bottom of the cup is thick it's nasty like a reconstituted grape juice puck yes exactly yeah yeah you want to know where that happened where right here where you can see me on this zoom call right on the corner of this desk i did a video a while back where i was like hey christians should try to get along with each other and we should even consider taking communion with people who aren't from the same tradition i was going to put that on the internet and then everybody was going to be like yeah we should get along better it was going to solve christianity and the world that was my plan with the video unfortunately it didn't it seemed to have made an interesting comment section but no no it turns out a lot of christians still really disagree with each other by a lot sometimes even angrily but what i did is i was like look here's some communion and so i had some little communion bread and a thing a grape juice that i went and bought and poured it was like the ocean spray whatever some cheap brand but i thought would look good on camera color wise so i poured it and i'm like i'm not drinking that and i said it aside right here and i recorded like 200 episodes of my daily podcast i was like i gotta remember to move that at some point it started to smell like wine and then i was like i don't want to put that in my sink and i just kept kicking the problem down the road until finally a kid you not a few weeks ago after moving it further and further away from myself i i eventually had to scrape out the reconstituted grape juice puck really i'm like i don't even as a spiritual analogy this is now completely ruined in terms of the wine and the bread and now i understand why other kinds of christians probably don't want to take communion it's a at some point it becomes leaven too because of the yeast it's growing in it yeah that too i did eat the bread so yeah i know what you're talking about we were talking about non-water floods so the idea is that if you let this just sit and evaporate you're going to get that fruit roll up sludge puck everywhere okay in your whole city 7.4 million gallons worth nobody died from the spill but here's a recurring theme that we're going to see as we talk about these non-water floods every i mean there's always a river somewhere and the concern became okay we can spray off the streets we can clean this up but we couldn't keep this out of the the river the dawn river and we're probably going to have gigantic environmental catastrophe when all the fish and russian alligators whatever else lives in that water drinks all of this fruit juice courtesy of pepsi but apparently the river just took it like a champ like a russian in a slapping contest it just takes it and is like whatever give me more because uh it was fine and there was no evidence of environmental damage whatsoever so you know thumbs up interesting okay all right so we got the brooklyn fudge flood we've got the pepsi fruit juice flood in russian 2017 what is our next one mm-hmm i think it's got to be me again because i'm guessing yours have a lot more now a lot of people died mine now we're just gonna go yours golly okay uh the next one up then is going to be the london beer flood this one's pretty famous i think a lot of people have heard of this one it was 17th of october 1814 okay you can look up what day of the week that is if you want october 17th yeah 1814 uh that's going to be october 17 1814 that's a tuesday wow okay another tuesday okay look i'm just going to warn you that there are some racial stereotypes that are going to seem like they're being reinforced by this story and i do not affirm these it just just this is what happened okay you've been warned okay enjoy your discomfort 17th of october 1814 you got some kind of incident that occurs chemically inside a giant 22 foot tall wooden vat of beer okay porter apparently it was in the process of fermenting it over fermented i guess i don't know how that works but i think i think i remember most of the chemical equation for fermentation so maybe they just drew the part where the expanding co2 they just drew that in really big letters and that's what happened and so then what happened is that the vat bursts but the building that is holding it the horseshoe brewery can't hold it and the walls give way it smashes through a brick wall and the beer 177 tons of this beer 388 000 gallons us just explodes out onto the street in this giant wave of partially fermented beer and so there's there's another wall in the way that gets smashed and the whole thing empties out into the london equivalent of flea bottom the name of this neighborhood is saint guile saint jiles rookery and then what happens is you got a bunch of irish people there okay now look again i'm not making any comment about anyone i'm just reporting what happened here as somebody whose blood runs with the blood of some irish ancestors as well i wouldn't want to be self-critical in this way so i mean nothing by it there's some irish people there they are apparently having a wake and then they get crushed by a bunch of beer and what was already a tragic event becomes even tragicker because eight people died oh in this wave of beer it's been it's been 208 years as of this recording so you can't quite laugh about it okay but we cannot i mean but we don't have to be totally serious i think 208 years buys you that what is the eight like how long this like when when is too soon like when can you laugh about things that happen that are ironic i think it depends i continue to remember that time that you and i went to that huhot restaurant yes in salt lake city and you go in there and they got a little jangus con menu for the little youngsters right and it's like your little con like that guy killed millions of people did horrible things to women and consumed food and beverage out of the skulls of his enemies he was a master genocider and you got a little eight-year-old here with a little con mustache on him like i'll have the cookies that i don't know apparently the scale of the atrocity is not it it's it's the passage of time because the scale of that atrocity says it's always too soon that is a very interesting point okay how many people died in the london beer flood the london beer flood you got eight people who died no joke five of them were at an irish wake for their little boy who had died like no joke a two-year-old kid had died and they were you know observing the the body and uh kind of the pre funeral stuff and then um and then this flood hits them and you're like my dang that is that's bad um yeah so so an irish wake is actually a drink um that that's a cocktail and i didn't know that it doubled as that okay it does and uh it is not beer it includes i'm looking at let's see rum bacardi there's some orange juice in there some other stuff i i that i don't know so apparently that's a drink that's bad the non-water flood that killed people that's the first one on the list that that people have died not happy about that no yeah so it was a 15 foot high wave that swept down two houses got destroyed a bunch of other property damage occurred and did we say the names of the victims we know because we actually know who died really yes this advance speak their names because really sad a four-year-old girl named hannah died she was having tea with her mom and another child and she just got i mean just got hit with this wave of beer out of nowhere uh the mother of that two-year-old little boy was one of the mourners who died when that wave hit her uh a girl named elinor cooper she was a uh 14-year-old she died as a result of that as well apparently she got pushed into a bunch of debris and was stuck and buried under there you got human carnage obviously in a way that you kind of want to giggle about because of how absurd it sounds but just imagine that being the way that you lost a loved one and you tell that story for the rest of your life how do you even strike that balance of the absurdity of the method of death with the tragedy of losing i mean these are all young people young people are grieving people that's everybody who died here any rate the beer ended up in people's basements and it all just ran down there and uh people either tried to pump it out or i mean they just couldn't get it out take it out in buckets i don't know it's not it's not good beer when it's half fermented and it's in your basement after running over filthy london streets there is a bunch of rumors about a bunch of people running out and trying to guzzle it real fast but it sounds like that's more just rumor than reality i think people knew not to drink it man this is gonna shock you a little bit but i did research on this as well what and um i've got this uh this cassette tape here oh yeah um a recording of i'm joking where i'm not doing that i'm so nervous i'm not doing this i'm like dude did you hear all the things i just said in the tone i just struck please please please don't make me barnacles and testicles this incident i'd rather do pump hay if you're uh if you're new to the no-dome questions podcast here uh back in the day uh matt and i used to uh do these little historical reenactments that were absurd and and the names of the characters were barnacles and testicles but for some reason um the fact that you said the names of the victims means we can't do that now so nope we can't but you told me to do it don't know how that works yes so that's what that's what happened there this episode of no-dome questions is sponsored by raycon raycon make fantastic earbuds that you can use anywhere anytime making part of your everyday carry because that's what i do and you do the same don't you matt yeah this started out as an everyday carry for me now two of my kids would call this part of their everyday carry as well and i kamil has been borrowing mine but she's getting the rose gold version for christmas this time around so it's fun to watch this leak out to a pattern where pretty much anybody in my family can be like oh i need earbuds anybody have something handy of minds in the truck and you know everybody can just answer well am i wearing pants and in that case yes there's always one available well it it makes sense that you're giving it to christmas so they have these holiday bundles this time around and if you check them out they've got four that i'm looking at the audio lover that's everyday earbuds plus everyday headphones that's a new product they have they've got an all-star bundle which is the everyday plus the fitness earbuds and they also have the everyday duo bundle which is two everyday earbuds and they have a gaming bundle or you can get gaming earbuds plus gaming headphones oh what's the gaming earbuds haven't looked at that yet oh okay they're you get purple oh that's purple good so yeah check out the holiday bundles as well that's a thing you can do and uh yeah if you'd like to support the podcast we'd be grateful buy raycon.com slash indq use the code early bf it says right here that's 20% off almost any raycon product which almost never happens it's usually just one thing but this is like anything or you can get even bigger savings and get 30% off if you get one of those exclusive holiday bundles the decim is just talking about sweet it's awesome yeah again super grateful that you would consider supporting the podcast by supporting the sponsor and genuinely these are good products you're gonna like them i use them all the time agreed i think you'll enjoy them buy raycon.com slash indq all right we got three non-water floods down you want more or should we just like just be done here yeah let's keep going that was uh the second one on a Tuesday it looks like one of mine has a has actually a lower death toll than the uh the beer flood uh let's hear about that one then okay so this actually happened in recent history in the nation of hungry it was on october 2010 so this is like not long ago what was it cuz october fourth 2010 let's see what day of the week that is some random website says that is a monday haha these are happening in the uh early part of the week october fourth 2010 so here's the deal imagine that you are a guy named toldy tamas and okay what you've wanted for a long time is to be the mayor of your town of divescar no divexar i think that's how you say it divexar hungry okay okay and you finally obtained your goal you you became the mayor of your town it's it's only the third mayor since you know hungry is no longer under communist rule and so yeah that night you just had a big party you know the the champagne was flowing everything was going great and um you decided you know what it is monday morning i'm just gonna sleep this off a little bit i'm just gonna have a little nap here i'm gonna sleep off my hangover and then you wake up your first day is mayor your phone starts ringing off the hook and everybody tells you hey the dam is broke and and and things are happening all over town people are getting hurt you in you're like what's going on so this guy's first day on the job toldy tamas as mayor was the day that the red toxic mud sludge flood occurred in the town from the neighboring aluminum works plant so um there was this this company just up the road what's so interesting about this the fact that this happened in 2010 means we had satellites in orbit at this point in time and you can actually see satellite imagery of this event so there's this process of making aluminum so what you do is you take bauxite which is an ore and oh x i t e i no i i think it's b-a-u-x-i-t-e so you're gonna be bauxite i don't know bauxite okay i got it i'm with you there's this process to get aluminum from bauxite and it's called the bayer process and a part of the bayer process is you use i i think it's sulfuric acid or something like this some really really nasty chemical involving um sulfur i i think it's h2 s4 you use sulfuric acid and you run it through the bauxite and that pulls the aluminum out but as it pulls the aluminum out you also get all this nasty nasty byproducts that has all kinds of awful stuff in it like cadmium and heavy metals and they call it red mud okay okay so as a an offshoot of this process they have to store the red mud and so this aluminum company just up the road they have these holding ponds and they they put all this stuff up there in the holding ponds always a great idea right let's just you know let's just put all this caustic nasty stuff uphill from this populated area right it so yeah what are your thoughts on that and it's going it's going into the holding ponds to settle out and separate so this this would be the the process by which you take the worst slurry and you allow however long it takes to separate out pumpable liquid from the the more solid elements then you pump the liquid to another holding pond and it separates again you pump to another holding pond it separates again is it that kind of strategy that old multi-tiered approach I don't know I don't want to I don't want to miss speak but I don't know this plant I can tell you this it was an alumina plant it was called the agica alumina plant ajk a and so they're they're doing all this stuff I think the the actual thing they're making is aluminum oxide at this plant which is interesting aluminum oxide you use it on like hardwood floors for example you can use as a coating what yeah it's weird really yeah so we had some hardwood floors one time coated with aluminum oxide because that gets a nice durable coat it's a really interesting thing but anyway long story but at the most basic level the point of a holding pond is usually it's a function of time right something needs to happen there and you're not holding it because you want what's in it you're holding it for the purposes of some kind of separation it's a temporary phase in a disposal process yes usually right yes and I'm sitting here looking at a breakdown of this red mud that comes out of the comes out of the the process so 40 to 45 percent of it was iron oxide which is why it looks like red mud it's it's like rust then 10 to 15 percent was aluminum oxide it looks like 10 to 15 percent of it was silicon dioxide six to ten percent was calcium oxide then you had titanium dioxide which interestingly titanium dioxide you can eat that stuff that's using like white cake icing and stuff and then there's also some wait wait wait wait I need to know for sure that wasn't sarcasm seriously have you eat that yeah yeah titanium dioxide is a tasteless additive used to turn your chocolate white icing paste yeah you can actually eat titanium dioxide it's just it's a strangest thing I saw bags of it one time and I was like what but it's a thing so okay yeah so all the stuff is in this slurry on top of that there's like weird stuff in there that actually makes this red mud radioactive it's awful but it's very very basic if I recall correctly that the pH is very basic and so the pH value of this red mud was 13 which is extremely basic so if this touches your skin it will burn you and like huge sores all over you so imagine you wake up and there's this huge red so basically this town in Hungary had had a a large a large duration of time where they've getting a lot of rain and so the holding pond like the the mud around the holding pond or the dirt around the holding pond was starting to move just like very gently they're like huh what's going on and then all of a sudden the rain stopped and on this particular day it was very dry and it was starting to dry out I don't know if you've ever seen after a period of droughts you'll you'll get the the mud starting to shrink and you'll get these cracks I'm assuming something like that came into play here because just magically boom the dam broke and this red mud wave just went straight down the streets took cars took all kinds of stuff ran down to the river and it killed 10 people I think immediately in the initial flow or people trying to get from one place to another and not understanding what kind of liquid they were dealing with I don't know and I didn't expose to it I don't know but you can actually go to the Wikipedia site on this this flood a J. K. A. aluminum plant accident and you can see imagery aerial imagery of it going down from the town like the holding pond was pretty far away but it's like ran down the street and just took out everything in this path it's awful so it looks like it was on the southeast side and from the satellite imagery here it it flowed to the northwest and if you were to draw if you were to draw looking at it like where would I not want to put a containment pond right awful stuff it's right over this town and that's exactly what they did yeah the only worst place would be like in a pool suspended on piers above like an elementary school or a nursery which is what we're going to get to next so anyway this way what yeah this one was awful so the the non water flood material was was this red mud stuff and so it's almost like a landslide only it's it's pooled up stuff is awful 10 people died and this was 2010 and again this happened on a Monday which for some reason matters to me so everything's happening in the early part of the week here so and I'm looking at a picture of this right now it's a picture of a forest and you can just see it looks like somebody went through and perfectly painted the first four feet five feet of each tree red yeah just exactly the same height so you can tell by the way the trees what the the paint line is so perfect you can tell that at this point it had to have been moving very slowly because that staining isn't high on one side of the tree you can't tell where the flow came from is my point in this photograph oh so even that gives me a little bit of a clue about the viscosity by the time it got here if it was six feet deep and I can't see a wash line in terms of the splash side of where it was coming from on all of this forest of trees it means this was oozing yeah at this level of depth so much higher viscosity yeah yeah yeah and so if you got caught up in that you physically wouldn't know what to do I mean that's a big part of the danger of quicksand and phenomena like that is it's escapeable it's just counterintuitive because every interaction you've had with fluid that would be deep enough for you to be in over the course of your life would condition you to behave differently than how you would need to behave in quicksand so you just get it wrong and you do things that that move you in the wrong direction it's a psychological killer I think it would be fascinating if I mean the odds are so slim but if there's like a listener that listens to notum questions like there's probably five people in Hungary maybe if we're lucky I think it'd be amazing to hear about this from a Hungarian point of view I think that'd be amazing so I don't know reach out to us if you're from Hungary and you heard if you heard about this in your in your nation I think it'd be amazing to hear about that anyway that was the Hungarian red mud flood the agica alumina plant accident 10 people were killed about 150 people were seriously injured it was a pretty big deal and I encourage you to go look at the satellite imagery from that what's interesting is you can just go read articles you just go to google find news articles from when this happened very interesting hmm wow that is a mess that dwarfs the next mess I was going to talk to you about okay I still think I want to touch on this one do it though it is disappointingly similar to the one you just described this one happened in the United States on December 22nd 2008 can you look up what is this the coal slurry containment pond or something wasn't there somewhere that's exactly what it is west Virginia one up to no no it's in Tennessee Tennessee I just remember hearing about this and so oh really yeah okay like this was actual news around here so so what it should be it was an incident that was handled by the tva the Tennessee valley authority yeah the tva has a daily impact on your life given where you live yes absolutely massive public works environmental management watershed management project dating back to the great depression the 1930s what why am I explaining this the tva is your lived reality what is it yeah I mean I can say this there are a huge hydroelectric power you're right it came about during the depression is one of the the main things of the new deal but all the dams were created up and down the Tennessee river here and there's a series of locks and stuff like that so if if I wanted to get my kayak and go to the Gulf of Mexico from north Alabama I first have to go north back into Tennessee and then kick over to the the Mississippi river and then go down but I have to go through a series of locks to do that because they control the level of the river and what's interesting about that is back in school I get to go to a briefing from one of the engineers that controls the levels of the river and they said that at every section of the river because there's so many dams they have like one thing that they know is the water shall not cross moment you know it's like so in the section between Florence and wherever they're like oh yeah you know mrs. Ethel's garden is at this altitude or this you know it's 760 feet or whatever it is and they're like oh you know we're about 10 foot away from mrs. Ethel's garden which is the lowest point on that section of the river where it would affect the local population and so he he told me about you know they have this control center where they try to figure all this out I would love to do something with the TVA for smarter every day but it's fascinating well in this particular situation there was I think still is a coal plant called the Kingston fossil plant in Kingston, Tennessee and apparently much like the situation you were talking about in Hungary some kind of settling pond or a series of settling ponds were key to their waste management process so they're burning a type of coal here that is apparently ground very fine I don't think that's how all coal plants work but everybody in this conversation who doesn't know much about coal plants raise their hand me okay looks like okay well I didn't think you would but I definitely don't know what I'm talking about or how this works the articles I read indicated that their process was one of a few different ways to process coal and that if you process coal in this fashion that you get this this slurry that is a byproduct you get something called coal fly ash okay and it's tough to nail down coal fly ash as I understand it as being one specific thing it can exist in multiple states of matter of cleaning because it takes a series of separation ponds to get down to a pumpable liquid that you can get rid of dispose of clean whatever and to get down to something that could I guess be scooped and removed I don't know what you do with the particulate matter that's leftover after the settling process occurs what do you call the leftovers there the dredges the the goop when the liquids pumped out the precipitate maybe I don't know I have no idea that sounded good that sounded real good yeah that's that sounds right to me so what happened here was they were still using in December of 2008 what day which was a Monday that was a Monday it's a Monday another Monday it's another Monday okay oh crazy and I think it happened in the middle of the night dude didn't really 1 a.m. eastern standard time really Monday morning now how see we thought we might see some patterns emerge okay no no what am I doing I'm taking partial credit for this the day of the week thing was entirely you it doesn't matter it's our thought we can have patterns might emerge and they have you brilliant man you that's awesome but brilliant though you may be let me tell you what you don't have what do I not have a cherry turnover yeah you still have that thing oh good for me that's good enough it's so flaky it's the thing you're flaky and that's why they're delicious okay so here's what happens so December 22nd 2008 they got these holding ponds now they've known for like 50 years dating back into the early 60s that this method for dealing with the coal fly ash was not the best way to do it and that it was intrinsically damaging to whatever container was holding it and so apparently for the previous eight years maybe six years they said they'd been doing repairs on this thing constantly every year they were having to do repairs when it got cold in the winter they were having to fix the thing up because the temperature changes it looks like contributed to some of the damage whoa so locals had a problem with it they had had concerns for some time this wasn't a mystery but i don't think anybody could have imagined what would happen if it actually just fully broke which it finally did one of these holding ponds would release about 4.2 million cubic meters that's 1.1 billion gallons of this partially separated coal fly ash slurry and what happened was there's about a one minute flow where the same thing you described the dam shows a little bit of weakness and then boom it just all goes wow but then there were successive spills that happened after that as other parts of the dam gradually became compromised as well so you get this one minute rush that took out a bunch of properties and somehow nobody died in that initial rush nobody houses were were destroyed uninhabitable something like 40 others were damaged so badly that i think they i think those houses ended up being restored to some degree of functionality blew out roads it destroyed some utilities gas lines a bunch of people got evacuated but apparently nobody even had to be hospitalized even though this turned out to be and now i'm just reading this to make sure i get this fact right it turned out to be the largest industrial spill in the history of the united states what three times larger than the martin county sludge spill of two thousand and significantly bigger a hundred times larger than the exon val dis oil spill this is an environmental disaster it is a calamity is the point so it sounds like this one's gonna have a happy ending because everybody got out and everybody was fine well then people have to come in to clean it up do you watch that share noble show on hbo i haven't actually i should but i have not watched it the initial explosion real bad but when they sent in the rescue crews that night to try to suppress the fire which is real tough with a hose to put out you know a nuclear meltdown that's when the disaster started to really strike do you have all these people in close proximity of the fallout and over the the coming weeks and months that's where you saw that death toll just skyrocket well the same thing happens here 40 deaths are attributed to people who came to work the cleanup and to investigate what went wrong and i'm not sure i totally understand medically what that exposure did to people but ultimately the determination was that the people in charge should have known what was going on with these holding ponds that there'd been sufficient evidence to say this wasn't a good idea it wasn't best practice for for a long time and there's just i'm just gonna read a sentence here uh the initial spill results in no injuries or deaths but several of the employees of an engineering firm hired by tva to clean up the spill develop illnesses including brain cancer lung cancer and leukemia as a result of exposure to toxic coal ash and by the 10 year anniversary the spill more than 30 had died um wow so uh the casualties thing on the wikipedia page says 40 deaths and 250 plus illnesses related to clean up wow that's huge man oh just what a cruel double whammy that in the you know it's a horrible event and a lot of damage but you kind of take this sigh of relief as a little community you're like well okay i mean we got a lot to clean up but we're going to come together we're going to get this done i mean this is a town of 6 000 people and then you realize that it's an environmental disaster with a really lasting legacy that ends up taking a bunch of people's lives as well and just pretty dark stuff wow you can see some aerial footage of the spill itself that coal ash looks like uh it looks like i don't know it doesn't look like mud it kind of looks like fluffy mud i don't know i don't know what it actually feels like but it looks like water is what gives it its ability to flow obviously that sounds dumb but but huh it's it's a weird stuff because if it looks like it crumbles away um do you know what slump factor is like um when you when you pour concrete factor slump yeah when you pour concrete they have these little cones and you take some of the concrete that you are pouring and you put it into the cone and then you flip it over and you see how much of the concrete slumps down like you you take take the cone off and then you measure the height of the the slumped concrete versus the height of the cone and that gives you uh something i don't know it's it has to do with the workability of the concrete interesting so it's the same test that you get in the dairy queen drive-through when you buy a blizzard and they flip it over to be like look we could do that if we wanted to it's just straight up upside down it didn't come out yeah that slump factor right kind of yeah that has to do with yeah i'll yes ish so i'll take it you just take a tape measure and then you you take your cone put the concrete in it flip it upside down remove the cone and then you measure how far down the concrete just kind of like bulges out at the bottom and as i look at this coal fly ash stuff it looks like it supports itself till it doesn't like you can see where it's kind of chipping away like if they had a big pile of it it would be good and then part of it would give away and it would all just start moving so it has some kind of structural integrity until a little part of it falls away and then it just all goes so with your understanding of fluid dynamics does that description that i was reciting to you uh does that fit with what you're observing looking at the coal fly ash itself that you would have one initial rush yeah and then sort of a bottleneck and then that would happen again yeah yeah that's what it looks like it's it's kind of weird looking it looks like it'd be very scary to approach like if you have a i'm imagining a levy breaking and then all the material just stays up like half of the levy came down and it's slumped down but you've got like all the liquid that would have been in the big pond just kind of stays there until something hits it at the bottom and it's like a little mini avalanche over and over yeah that's what i was going to say it sounds like the way an avalanche would behave yeah not with white pretty pristine snow have you ever been in an avalanche i haven't no they're terrifying have you yeah yeah it's a thing really uh i've been close to some whoppers i've seen legit avalanche cheese in yoming and colorado and i've been in some cute little ones where it never got above my hips which i mean if you're familiar with my stature isn't really much of an achievement for an avalanche anyway but you're modest it's crazy even just a mild little we're just goofing around in the hills and something comes loose and there's just there's not that much snow to come loose you're talking about maybe a 30 or 40 foot little little run of snow before there's nothing above it and maybe you know a couple times i've been hoofing it across there to go fish something i wanted to fish in the winter and just worked things loose and it's like all right i'm not in any danger here i can see the volume of snow that is available to come down upon me but even that it's really goofy how you just sort of surf in it until you don't and all of a sudden you're kind of locked in and then you move with it for a little while it's it's a very strange thing and it makes me better appreciate what it would be like to encounter something had enough slump factor is the right term here but something that has that it's holding together until it's not kind of factor and then you get the full force of all of that potential energy at once i see how that'd be horrifying scary that sounds scary okay so that was the kingston coal plant coal fly ash disaster i have a taxonomical question for you at this point okay does an avalanche count as a non-water flood i mean it's water but it's not water in its liquid state what category does an avalanche get or like a landslide a landslide i guess it matters like the liquid content well maybe not liquid content because i've got one coming up that's not liquid so you mentioned pyrocla i don't know the word what is the word pyroclastic pyroclastic is there an elo pyroclastic flow yeah i mean ask a ladriel from that lord of the rings show because she's more familiar with how to survive one of those than anyone you just stand right there and let it roll over you absolutely no problem whatsoever if it's not worth it you're an important character let's go to the um let's do pompey because you mentioned pompey right yeah pyroclastic i just googled that sucker it's one of those words i always mumble out of because i'm afraid of it yeah i'm gonna like somebody's name you don't know what's up karlin and samil should we go pompey or should we go molasses what should we do next well more people die to pompey i think then die to the molasses flood let's go molasses okay molasses it is you're getting this one right yeah yeah i'll get this one so uh the i don't have any notes but but this came up in your college education didn't it like weeks ago so i'm studying for this test and i'm one of the tests i was taking was about mechanical failure and the professor she's up there teaching and she goes oh yeah and then there's this you know this is why it's important to calculate stress concentrations on stuff like this and she brings up the molasses flood in boston 1919 is that right 1919 january of 1919 what day was it great question i don't know but i'm gonna find out yeah so she brings up the great molasses flood boston 1919 january 15 1919 there's this big vat of molasses that's being used uh by this company called the purity distilling company interestingly didn't know this molasses was used in world war one as a way to make alcohol which was used in the production of bombs in what yeah i didn't know that so so here's the deal prohibition was just about to start like they had already voted in prohibition and so this company is like hey we we don't make bombs anymore but we have this process to make alcohol wow and so uh we've got about one year until prohibition comes into effect so we need to make as much booze as possible so this big vat that they had um up up in boston on the north end pretty close to the water they were pumping molasses up into this vat and um they said they had pumped molasses into this thing many many times but as soon as this vat gets uh installed uh they're in the town everybody starts talking about it like hey this thing is uh leaking like that look at it's it's leaking and the company's like oh yeah whatever um we'll just paint it molasses colored so you can't see so they they used a camouflage technique to try to um kind of you know oh you can't see the leak so we're talking 2.3 million gallons of molasses in this thing now this is the interesting thing about the class i was taking so we talked about failure analysis and so when you have a tank like a pressure vessel you have two types of stress primarily you have axial stress which is um like let's say you have a uh like a propane tank you ever seen a propane tank outside somebody's house so you get this along like a big one yeah like a big one a horizontal yeah i've i've had one of those at a property before sure okay so if you were to pressurize that thing with gas like like you know air and you were just keep pumping air in that then there's two types of stresses that would happen the first type of stress would try to blow the ends off the tank that's called axial stress all right the second type of stress would try to rip the tank lengthwise and that's called hoop stress so if you were to take an air hose and you were put it in your mouth and you were to pump your body up with air your belt would blow off before the top of your head blew off this is the way my professor said it and so the the hoop stress is is um is higher than the axial stress and so it's really interesting the way all this stuff works out so when you look at a water tank up high on a mountain you got other things happening right so like the cylindricalness of the tank wants to come apart like you think of oh well that water is so heavy up there it's just going to come crashing down because the legs won't be able to handle it you think that's how it would break but this is a little bit confusing because we're talking about a propane tank those are usually long like a sausage or a tootsie roll okay so stand it upright but yeah that's what i'm that's what i'm saying we got to rotate this 90 degrees yep for this molasses fat okay got it so in this case the hoop vulnerability yep is running horizontally exactly around it okay gotcha yeah so typically when you look at stuff like this when engineers make a tank or something like that they think about the hoop stress and the axial stress and stuff like that my question for this tank is what happened at the bottom corner like is the bottom of this tank rounded like is is it spherical or is it just like a 90 degree angle because if it's a 90 degree angle then that's definitely where it's going to fail so i have a question yes hold on trying to picture this myself i've always pictured this molasses fat being like a barrel which is ridiculous like surely it was not the shape of a barrel but when you think about old timey things that hold confections and sweet sugary things you just picture a barrel because of laziness but is it possible that this is more like one of those holding tanks you see from the mid-century and small town america that is effectively just a circular container with a domed top i mean it seems to me that that would be the most logical structure to contain this volume of molasses as opposed to something more like a barrel shape where it's rounded or it tucks in there's actually photos of it so i don't know if you've ever been going you know when you take off in an airplane you can see where they keep the fuel at the airport they're usually really big cylinders of steel they're just cylindrical vessels of steel yeah but not like a silo on a farm it's something fatter and shorter great way to describe it exactly got it yeah yes so we're talking about the same thing yep so it's one of those i think it was actually up in the air i don't know that to be true but i hear people talking about it being over so i think it was actually off the ground that may not be true it may have been on the ground if i was an engineer that was doing this i would definitely want it on the ground but so maybe picture one of those little water containment like like wood stilted short water towers that you see on the roofs of buildings and old depictions of new york or the Warner brothers water tower that you see in animaniacs just slightly elevated off the ground maybe maybe i don't know the important thing is that it was made of steel okay and um they think the way it ripped is people reported hearing sounds like a machine gun firing like that like that and that would be the rivets ripping apart because back in the day they were still in the early days of metallurgy and they were trying to understand how to put things together you can't just like now there's a welder in the garage here i can just go weld things but that's a whole art welding is a skilled trade it's very difficult to do but they didn't understand other things like what makes metal brittle versus uh you know there's like there's a whole field about what is martensite what is austinite these are different types of steel well later after analyzing what happened after the fact they found that this particular type of steel didn't have the correct level of manganese in the steel which ended up making the steel more brittle in my class when the professor pulled this information up she actually put it on the board when we were learning about stress concentrations and she said we think at this point in time that the great molasses flood in boston happened because of stress concentrations around a port hole due to how it was riveted together so you heat up these rivets back in the day you know you have a bucking bar on the backside you bang these rivets together and you can kind of sandwich two plates together well i mean that's that's going to seal but not perfectly right but you heat it up the rivets to do all the stuff and you're adding stress as you're banging these things together and so there was a stress concentration at that port hole and that's where they think it failed now they reported that they had filled this tank up four times almost to complete capacity but this was the first time they'd ever gone all the way and filled it up which means the pressure in the bottom of the tank would be way higher sure and it just gave way and what happened after the fact was deadly what day of the week did we figure out what day of the week this happened on wednesday it happened on a wednesday okay and this was january 50 or 19th-night-day wednesday but the problem was it was in the middle of the day right yeah not 1 a.m so with this one you just get this bizarre rolling avalanche of sweet sludge that is both freaky at first but then a curiosity which is part of the problem what do you mean well as i understand it the fact that people didn't recognize the threat immediately is part of what went wrong you have no context for how you would move in something like that and so it sounds like the urgency throughout the spill wasn't the same as it would have benefited been a fiery explosion or a wall of water rolling toward you you can sort of conceptualize that this is a scenario that nobody who is strolling around downtown boston at the time had really considered yeah one of the things that i read about is like horses actually drowned in the molasses yeah and so it sounded funny and and newspapers all over the country picked it up but it was it it was a tragedy like people got stuck people tried to save other people and they they ended up dying themselves so there was like actual heroes in the middle of all this and um it was just awful so the sticky mess was everywhere i think it was 21 people died um they said 150 people were injured at least one person got swept out into was is it the harbor there is that where they are is it just well yeah didn't it just flow out into boston harbor eventually no actually it didn't they they tried to figure out how to get rid of it um i read a thing where they were talking about all the different techniques they were trying to use to get rid of it they tried water for fire hydrants they couldn't get that to work they tried burning it in times they tried shovels they tried to just break it up when it started getting hard but it never gets completely hard which is kind of the problem because you can't just break it and put it in a wheelbarrow it's like always this imagine dipping a honeydipper into a big kitty-sized swimming pool of honey and trying to load that into a wheelbarrow because of the viscosity your shovels gonna be like coated it's just a nightmare and the honey is cold yeah super what this was january right oh yeah that's awful and so it was a fireman that eventually said hey why don't we pump the water from boston harbor up into it's the harbor i don't know boston very well but i think it is uh boston harbor they they pumped the water from boston harbor up into the molasses and something about the salt in the water ended up diluting and kind of thinning it out enough where they could just kind of push it out into the harbor but the thing that's really crazy to think about is you had basements you know whole buildings were just taken away off their foundations like a fire station was just demolished imagine having your entire basement if you have a basement filled with molasses whoa what do you do that is a problem yeah i got no plan you know that my basement flooded with actual water a few times in wyoming when i lived there i lived at the top of a hill and for whatever reason we had this bizarre little bit of underwater ground pressure that plagued my yard a local there i was talking to it was like oh yeah i know where you live we all used to ride bikes up to the top of that hill when we were kids back in the 1950s and there was a spring up there i was like wait like right at the top of the hill yeah right at the top of the dang it stupid thing so my basement kept flooding all the time and i just think about what a pain in the butt it was to move water out of my basement again and again but all of the pump option goes away immediately when you have something as viscous as molasses or even approaching molasses you got gravity working against you you're kind of done it's just bricked i don't burn it cover it over with concrete and move on what do you do it's a problem i listened to a podcast that interviewed an author that just to reference my sources here the podcast was the great boston molasses flood by history this week i think it's put on by the history channel maybe and there's an author that was interviewed named steven pulio and and he said one of the major factors that contributed to this happening was the fact that this particular area of boston was just super super dense with atalian immigrants who at the time didn't speak a lot of english and so people were like oh yeah the molasses is leaking out of the vat not a big deal and so people knew it was happening and they knew the integrity of the tank was not good but they kind of turned a blind eye to it they didn't really care yes the the firm that created the tank they were reputable they had made it made many other tanks in the past but as soon as they put this on i mean there were reports of kids and this is why i think the tank was elevated there were reports of kids using pales to collect molasses under the tank as it was drip out hmm and so just this big thing where people didn't really care and maybe it had something to do with you know the lower class immigrant population of the neighborhood maybe i don't know but another thing that uh mr pulio pointed out in the podcast i'll listen to was that the results of this event changed engineering forever in in this country or at least now modern engineering standards so a professional engineer when they design something they have to put their stamp on it and now they become responsible for the results of their engineering design and they they become culpable if something happens and and something breaks and there's victims from a tragedy of something they stamped so this whole infrastructure of accountability is set up as a result of the great boston molasses flood of 1919 which is interesting and i know you have opinions about that you don't like more government regulation but i think it's very interesting that a lot of these things that we're talking about like the coal fly ash you know they they knew there was an issue the in hungry um the the standards of the the levies or you know the the earthen works dams around these things they started losing integrity and there were people in charge of that so are these people at fault um you know in some cases there there doesn't seem to be anyone that knew the thing was about to happen but what are your thoughts on that going all the way back to Persia and rome there are unique consequences for engineers who screw things up this is not a new concept in the west and i do consider Persia to be part of the west it's well a mingling of west and east there were some stunning and unique consequences if you built something and that something failed and you know i want to have a conversation about clever maniacal ancient torture and execution method someday so i'll save it for that conversation now let me just clarify my position here so for me public morality starts with person and property you own you you own the things that your past work enabled you to buy and apprehend so where government is one solution for protecting that i like it when it protects person and property if we have a shared ethic of you own your body and you own your stuff and i own my body and i own my stuff and that's where the law flows out of then it doesn't matter if i'm a muslim abutist and atheist a christian whatever if we both agree that regardless of your opinions beliefs orientations whatever you own you you can make a pretty robust standard of laws out of that i don't think that cell phone charger tips rises to the level of protecting person and property that to me looks like it gets into more things that the free market could solve or ways to enrich politicians and lobbyists business people so i just want to make that distinction between the two things let me put it this way the sloppy mismanagement of that tank because of its physical proximity to other people was an aggression against the person and property of all of the neighbors who shared that if somebody goes and dumps a bunch of coal fly ash into a river well that's an aggression against all of your neighbors and everyone who is downstream from that i think it's perfectly reasonable for society to come together and say those are abuses we just won't tolerate and those are risks that we want to say and we want to be able to speak to whether or not your stupid tank will do what it's going to do so thank you for indulging me that tiny little aside but wait what was your original question i got all excited about about public morality and ridiculous political philosophy no no i i think you answered it i i think you answered it like someone should be held responsible for this yeah i'm of two minds because i'm i'm actually scared of getting what's called a p e license so i just recently took this big hard test and my mind is pretty sharp on you know how to do these calculations right now and so i'm considering going to take the p e exam i don't know what that is what is p e professional engineer so if if you pass the p e exam then you can stamp drawings this says hey this person is knowledgeable in the art of designing beans for houses this person is knowledgeable in the art of sizing pumps or whatever it is that you get your license for what happens if you stamp something and it doesn't work what's the penalty it depends on the the consequences of but yeah you're held responsible for your design criminally liable or civilly liable i don't know i don't know i think it's criminal so you that's that's a very important distinction criminal liability i think could only be established i'm spitball in here in situations like what we're talking about with this tank or a modern version of that if you had clearly been instructed by some societal oversight board to say that is dangerous and needs to be resolved immediately and you intentionally obfuscated or refused to do something about it there may be criminal liability there there may be should be criminal liability there but generally civil liability is what i would expect that you could be sued for money not put in jail i know this i know molasses flows downhill and so if if you were to do some type of p e certification and you were to work for an engineering firm right now and you were to design a tank and it were to fail yes the company that hired the firm to create the tank they're going to sue the firm right what i don't know is if the firm is going to sue the employee that actually did the thing i don't know how that works but what's interesting is a lot of these concepts came about because of this molasses flood which i think is fascinating so i don't know i indeed it is and that came about because of the pressures that the temperance movement put on people who made molasses so it's overzealous religious people that made all this happen i mean it's it's i mean honestly the temperance move a whole account man we i think it'd be great to do a whole thing on the temperance movement but i think about it you have a bunch of people like kara nation billy sunday kara nation was a prohibitionist who went around and smashed up actual saloons with an axe like just some lady who'd be like alcohol is so bad and destructive she'd go and wreck people's stuff and and this got political momentum after abolition was more or less taken care of than like you kind of everybody needs a cause there's always a cause to jure there's always a current thing some of those current things are more worthy than others abolition certainly being one of the more worthy but the whole temperance thing alcohol got real cheap because of industrialization that we're talking about here and alcohol went from being a thing that people didn't have the patience to ferment and cure all the way out to its full potency so they were drinking stuff that usually wasn't incredibly powerful and they could only afford so much but public water supplies in the late industrial age were a disaster so it's actually better to drink cheap alcohol as a substitute in the minds of many for the garbage water that was being provided publicly and as a result domestic abuse skyrockets prison populations skyrockets you get all these problems in the late 19th century that then cause religious people and social progressives and odd alliance to partner together to say we got to stop this thing and all of that brings us back to the point where they passed some legis well not some legislation a full blown constitutional amendment that stood for 13 years the only one that's ever been repealed fully repealed and and that puts all kinds of pressure on people who've been in business making booze for a century or two and what are they going to do just shut everything down or try to pivot well they try to pivot you get different benchmarks that you have to hit you have new production means that you have to hit and as a result some corners get cut blah blah blah blah long story short whole bunch of molasses floods everything and horses drown in there it's crazy man yeah we should do a whole interconnected that's the point i would love to have a a discussion with you about alcohol sometime it gives i i can attest from you know personal experience family wise that it's it's destructive in nature but i think yeah we should just talk about that because i think that would be an interesting discussion so i think it would be too okay well table it thank you for indulging me briefly molasses flood of 1919 happened on a wednesday i've got one more big thing but do you have anything else we need to discuss before we go now we certainly haven't covered all the non-water floods in history but uh i mean do you want to talk pompey or what yeah and this is interesting i'm seeing some new taxonomy or clarification on our taxonomy evolving as we're going along in our discussion here an avalanche i mean it's snow it's water it's a water flood but it's different it's so different in terms of viscosity that it doesn't act like a water flood a mudslide is so different in viscosity that it you can't rightly call it a flood but it kind of acts like a flood i think i know what your final example is going to be that's natural and not man-made as well certainly a volcanic eruption and a pyroclastic flow that's not man-made but it's kind of it behaves like a flood so it seemed like you got two different categories here with three you've got your traditional water flood then you've got your other things that happen in nature that are flood-like but are made of a different substance or or water in a different state of matter and then you've got your man-made stuff where the actual flood medium is something that people crafted be it oil or sludge or slurry or waste or fruit juice or molasses or chocolate or whatever it might be so i'm always excited when the categories take on a little bit more clarity and i i think we're gradually achieving that here that makes me a little less enthusiastic to talk about the eruption of mount visuvius but the quick version and i think we do need this one to be quick because i want to get to your last one is just 79 ad mount visuvius blew up and it buried a couple of towns the famous town oh wait what what was the date i we surely we know the actual date of this uh it's somewhere in the fall i don't think we actually know the date we have to know the date what day did i think it's just the fall august 24th 79 that's a date what yeah so august i don't think that's right you don't think so no i think it happened later in the year i okay i'm gonna go look i'm i'm on the computer right now uh because it's a Tuesday let's see i got i got a no i got a no okay here we go historians have long believed that mount visuvius erupted on 24th of august 79 ad destroying the nearby roman city of pompey but now an inscription has been uncovered dated to mid october almost two months later you can't have an inscription in pompey two months after the volcanic eruption that buried the entire city how can we not know that like he was like a whole city just gone how can we not know when that happened yeah and it's kind of crazy too because one of the greatest historians in antiquity plenty the younger was there and another famous historian plenty the elder died in that eruption really yeah so you think he would be like hey my uh oh yeah and he did okay wait a minute oh this is really fun yes plenty the younger specifically said on the 24th of august about one in the afternoon my mother desired him to observe a cloud and then he goes into the description of what he saw as an eyewitness i i'm looking at a bbc article i'm skimming it the plenty the younger was he was in a ship out at sea and i think plenty the elder died trying to shuttle people back and forth out of pompey uh and the neighboring community i it's another one of these names that i always mumble because i'm a little afraid to say it but herculaneum wow i think is the name of the other town that got destroyed there so i think we have to say there is ambiguity as to the actual date of the pompey eruption okay at this point okay sounds good i'm calling it tuesday it happened on a tuesday don't know let's go but one in the afternoon plenty was probably right about that have you been to pompey no it's like i want to go so bad i've i've asked my wife if uh we can splurge for our 20th wedding anniversary and go um but i don't know if it'll happen but i really want to that would be fantastic it's a neat sobering stop you know how you got these things that happen from time to time in life and a few nerals being the obvious one but things that just force you to stop and think about mortality yes it's a certain type of movie that you watch book a story a song whatever when the leaves come off in the fall heck that'll do it i don't think i've ever had a more poignant encounter with the passage of time and my own mortality then my visits to pompey particularly the first one there is this one section called garden of the fugitives and i think people who haven't been there before imagine that all of pompey is like this because it's the image you always see but it's a family lined up trying to retreat and you can look at the size and body proportions of the people who are entombed in ash in the moment they died and you can see like okay that's the dad oh he realized the family couldn't keep up and he's turning back to try to help but he can't get any further and oh that's the mom and that's the kids and the grandparents they went down first wow you can see what the flight looked like and you can reestablish in your brain how quick this thing would have hit so it happened that instantaneously yeah people survived people got out and my understanding is that the flow the wall of ash wasn't evenly distributed over everything the excavation depths were different the ash assembled and stacked up at different rates some people saw it coming and chose to go some people saw it coming and thought well that wouldn't get here that's a long ways away and it is a long ways away when you stand there and look up at the mountain you're like dang that that had to cover a lot of ground really fast to catch people in these particular poses to catch a dog in that particular pose that's crazy how fast that must have hit 20,000 people lived in those cities we have no idea how many people died but according to this article pretty well known statistic uh 1500 bodies or negatives where the bodies would have been have been discovered at this point and they're not even fully excavated at all so I mean it could be that a vast majority of people died I remember seeing a weekly reader when I was a kid that kind of had uh an estimate of the population I think it was the same estimate around 20,000 between the two towns and it had a lower number at that point because they were earlier in the excavation process which has been going on for 150 pushing 200 years and they said maybe a thousand people died because that's how many bodies have been discovered well that's not even close to the total death count there and it's possible pretty much everybody died save a few witnesses I'm seeing one thing here that says 1500 to 3500 possibly up to 16,000 oh there we go okay wow that's a lot uh that's a lot in terms of a flood event it has some of the same anatomy in terms of the human psychology and the response right did you see the avalanche video I feel like maybe we shared it back and forth on twitter the avalanche video that was circulating here a while back where the guy is just filming some vertical video he's like look at the avalanche far far away and it comes like right up to him yeah yes a duck behind a big rock and you're like dang dude that's getting really close oh I can't believe how far that's you need to take cover immediately and you go from neat to oh crap the guy with the camera is gonna die in what 10 seconds right it's it's unbelievable how fast it's coming at him yeah and now imagine instead of ice death that theoretically you might be able to get on top of and swim out of like they coach you to do in an avalanche there's no escaping this despite again the portrayal of Galadriel in the rings of power there's no escaping this if you're caught up in this you have no air to breathe everything is choked out and gone you're gonna get one lung full of this stuff and you're gonna fall to the ground and you're gonna be overcome with heat and then this partially liquid kind of heavy odd floating volcanic ash is gonna pile up on top of you compress over time and there you are entombed for all of eternity just like that this one has it's always captured my imagination since that weekly reader in miss mac mohans third grade class I've just always been kind of mortified by this account I I think it counts I think this counts as a flood because of the way it happened it's not necessarily liquid but I mean flow pyroclastic flow and it just comes over you I think it's a crazy thing man so man that's awful that's awful this episode of no dumb questions is brought to you by the patrons the people who support this program at patreon.com slash no dumb questions you don't have to do that because it's free but you do and that's awesome and it's not just Destin and I who are grateful that our wives our kids it's the stabilizing force that makes this thing long term make sense don't get me wrong we could not be more grateful to the sponsors who support the program and kick in in the way that they do and we're so grateful to everybody who's responded to those sponsorships but you who are most invested in this thing and support it you're the heartbeat of it you're the reason that the podcast ultimately exists that the conversation keeps going on and it's important to us that you understand that a ton now let's go back to fumblingly trying to thread the needle between having a laugh about ridiculous sounding floods and also being very serious because it actually had consequences thanks again I have one more thing to talk about okay that I think is very very interesting this is something I'm only recently I've only recently learned about they're called the death lakes in Africa have you if you heard of this no I mean you tipped your hand a little bit about this topic so I went and flirted with it and then backed way off because I just wanted to learn it from you and it seems super interesting but no I did not know about this prior to just before we jumped on mike's here okay so there is this phenomenon that happens in certain lakes in the world um recently there's a lake in Cameroon in Africa have you ever been to Cameroon I have yeah I've been into Younday a few times tell me about Cameroon I've never been there um it's a developing world nation it sits right in like not the metaphorical armpit but kind of the armpit the bend the undertuck of Africa on its west coast it borders Nigeria Nigeria is to its north and west and Equatorial Guinea is to its south divided by a big river there I've been on both sides of that river Younday is not a gorgeous city it kind of has that look of mid-century western money trying to prop up a cooperative government and I once got stuck on the runway there somebody hit a plane with a baggage cart I've told you about this before and we all got escorted off of the plane into a holding cell while they figured out whether it was some kind of attack or plot in Cameroon this happened to you yeah what old old rusty a.k.47s who's younday now uh it was in dewala Cameroon yeah it was dewala and we were on our way to Nigeria eventually to Paris and they took us all into this holding cell people from around different countries in Africa uh Cameroon citizens a bunch of American doctors were on the flight and they they put us all in there no bathroom no nothing dudes in dark green camouflage with their AKs at the door metal over the windows no bathrooms or anything didn't tell us how long we'd be there no food nothing pretty soon people started having to go to the bathroom and so folks would make like human shelters in the corner for men and women to use one corner that we designated as a bathroom what yep and nobody I mean we said no idea what was gonna happen and then without any explanation they just came back in they're like okay and just made a row so we wouldn't leave the tunnel row of guards with their I don't know if they had like little berry's it was that kind of look and they got their AKs and we just had to walk between them we got back in our seats and very quickly took off and then once we were out of Cameroonian airspace the Air France captain or somebody came on was like hey uh a baggage car hit the plane the plane is fine it was a lot I mean it was light contact somebody from the ground crew made a mistake they panicked and you know we were wildly late to Paris they put us up and I ended up staying in Paris for an day or so as a result so yeah I got some I got some Cameroon stories is the point I've been around there a little bit this is a okay the the question I'm about to ask you is very juvenile but like okay just everybody did they just number one in the corner or were there some number two that had to happen in the corner I didn't go check the corner man it didn't smell good okay like I didn't go over and inspect like ma'am are you done I just wanted to see what you left oh wow oh mercy like I didn't realize I served corn on the cob on this flight I didn't go over there at all like I'm not gonna go inspect that but it smelled real bad man dude that is so bizarre to go from like hey we're just all check us out whoa we're like at like base level body let's keep our bodies alive level very quickly so sounds like you don't have great memories from Cameroon it was fine the other times I was there it's just real bad passing through that one night oh wow that is wild man okay so there is a lake in Cameroon called Lake Nios in YOS like Nios what part of the country is it in I'm gonna look it up I think it's in the north I'm not really sure okay not really up on my camera I just all of my research has focused on this one lake I don't know anything about where it is or context or anything all right but if you look up the lake Nios disaster I am going to call this a flood okay and the reason I'm going to call this a flood there used to be this little experiment we would do in chemistry class where we would take you know something like vinegar and bacon just bacon so we put it together and it would like erupt and make you know a little volcano thing but it made carbon dioxide and you could capture the carbon dioxide and then if you had like a candle you could get a cup of carbon dioxide and you could pour the carbon dioxide out on the candle and you could extinguish the candle have you ever seen this simple demonstration no I'm not so so carbon dioxide is heavier than air so you can contain that I knew yeah okay so you can contain it in a cup and because of buoyancy went forces you can take that carbon dioxide and just pour it out on the table and you can't see it but you can imagine that it would flood over the table in front of you a quick note northwest Cameroon close to the Nigerian border got it got it so there's this thing that happened well one of the thing carbon dioxide is also you've drank soft drinks before and you've got that that fizzy taste or that it's almost like a burn have you felt that burn of yeah we need to rip up carbon dioxide or whatever we used to use on the range sometimes we would condition the rounds before we would fire them the rockets we we would say hey we need to we need to test this one at minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit so one of the ways we would get it that cold is we would use carbon dioxide and we would chill the rounds and so we had this little box just imagine something probably about the same size as the holding cell you guys were in um imagine a small room and you would just run uh co2 through there super super cold like the you know you use liquid co2 to just chill is that what's in the thing that I used to spray electronics and like the little spray cans that dust off a keyboard or something I don't know what that is that's probably some type of propellant but I don't know but um what we would do is we always had to worry about asphyxiation hazards when we would get to the missiles we'd say hey um the crew you guys need to go get the cold rocket and you'd open this door and all this carbon oxide would come flooding out onto the ground around you and it was so incredibly cold but it would also if you breathed it in it would just burn really really bad but it's just co2 so there's not a like a poison hazard or anything like that but there isn't asphyxiation hazard yeah it just isn't oxygen correct but it does burn and that's a homable oxygen right and so that's you immediately know what's going on because it hurts okay so uh on thursday august 21st 1986 there was something that occurred in lake nios called a limnic eruption that's l-i-m-n-i-c limnic eruption okay so this lake in camaroon has a very high concentration of carbon dioxide in the bottom of the lake because it's always hot in camaroon you know typically you've got a you've got hot air rises right and hot water will rise and and you've been scuba diving or you've been snorkeling and you've felt the thermocline when you go under the water you kind of bust through this layer and you can get down to the cold water you've felt that before yeah and i've seen the way trout behave as water temperature change at different depth than a mountain lake right well in camaroon there's a like a perfect storm of geology and temperature gradients and all the things there's a volcano nearby and carbon dioxide is being fed through the the volcanic rock at the bottom of this lake and there's this huge buildup of carbon dioxide at the bottom of the lake and it's contained there in like a super saturation every once in a while it will all just instantly boil off it's maybe not boil office maybe not the term but it comes out of saturation and you have this gigantic eruption is the word of the lake and it just spews out carbon dioxide i'm talking an incredible amount of carbon dioxide and on the 21st of august and i just like a bubble like a belch yeah yeah the gas comes out of saturation you know how when you open it's like opening a coca cola and if you open it and it's under tremendous pressure you've seen some i shake up a coke or a dr pepper or something like that sure you open it and it'll spew everywhere right right that is carbon dioxide in saturation and a liquid that's what that is so imagine an entire lake that has a super saturation of carbon dioxide in it and something happens i don't know what it is but something triggers the you know you've seen the the mentos and diet coke experiment and the mentos is the thing that triggers the you know the release of the carbon oxide yeah imagine that but an entire lake and now imagine a village next to that lake where people live and the amount of carbon dioxide that could be saturated in a lake and because carbon oxide is heavier than air just like you can pour out the carbon dioxide over a candle that happens at the lake so boom all of a sudden all the carbon dioxide comes up from the water and it just does what it floods right next to the shoreline it floods over the lake itself it floods right next to the shoreline and and runs downhill yeah yeah this is a 3,600 foot high lake in terms of elevation so it's got a lot of drop a lot of opportunity for that to run 1746 people died on this day and 3,500 livestock sheep cows things like that all of these people and animals asphyxiated i know from pulling rockets out of conditioning boxes that one of the last things they felt would have been a burning sensation in their mouth and lungs it's awful but this is a thing that happens and there's only a few places that it's known that there's three lakes over in that area one of them is lake nios where this happened there's another one nearby in Cameroon called lake monoun m-o-n-o-u-n i mean this is a known phenomenon that happens and so what they're doing is they're trying to figure out how to get the carbon dioxide out of saturation so this is a gigantic tragedy can you imagine oh do we know what time this happened i don't know i'm looking that up now it's in the middle of the night in the middle of the night so a lot of people would have died in their sleep at yeah there's a first-hand account of somebody who woke up while it was happening it's horrible dude really horrible yeah i'm gonna read it this is sad if people want to skip a minute ahead i get it this is sad do it there's a survivor named joseph nakwain from saboom one of the villages and he said i could not speak i became unconscious i could not open my mouth because then i smelled to something terrible i heard my daughter snoring in a terrible way very abnormal when crossing to my daughter's bed i collapsed and fell i was there till nine o'clock in the morning of friday the next day until a friend of mine came and knocked at my door i was surprised to see that my trousers were red had some stains like honey i saw some starchy mess on my body my arms had some wounds i don't really know how i got those wounds i opened the door i wanted to speak my breath would not come out my daughter was already dead i went into my daughter's bed thinking that she was still sleeping i slept then till it was four thirty in the afternoon on friday that same day then i managed to go over to my neighbors houses they were all dead i decided to leave because most of my family was in womb another village i guess i got my motorcycle a friend whose father had died left with me as i rode through nios i didn't see any sign of any living thing when i got to womb i was unable to walk even to talk my body was completely weak godly man that's can you imagine that you go to bed you wake up and you can't function it's just nothing's right air is not right your body's not right you can't talk you struggle to get breath the first thing you're going to want to go do is check on your daughter and you can't make your way all the way across the room it takes two bouts of sleep to make it from your bed over to your daughter's bed and when you get there she's gone i mean this is such a matter of fact description of the events but the emotion behind it is really easy to imagine it's awful man it's awful i would categorize this as a flood because it yeah it just totally engulfs everything imagine that man that many people just died you know many did not wake up so i don't know if it felt like hypoxia which i've experienced which is a lack of oxygen in the brain i don't know what it would have felt like but it's you know 1746 people died that's amazing pivoting slightly you started to talk about what they're doing to try to prevent something like this in the future yeah how does that work how do you combat something that's happening so deep underwater it's something that's so natural well what's crazy is these events don't happen often like they happen so sparingly the period between the times that this happens is longer than a human lifespan so you may have heard of the hunger stones um you've heard of hunger stones where they're like hey if the water level ever gets below this stone start crying because you know there's there's not going to be you know your famine is coming or stuff like that and japan you've you've seen stones that says do not build your house below this stone because a tsunami could get you and so there are efforts from previous generations to try to warn those in the future that may not even you know know that the previous generation existed and that's the kind of event that olympic eruption is because it takes so long for the carbon dioxide to build up in the water that you just don't know and so um they have some attempts they're using engineering methods to degas they've got pumps that they're using to try to get the carbon dioxide up i mean it sounds silly but when i drink um tea i drink half and half tea i mix my tea up and that's that's a discussion we need to have with dalein at another time he and i have opinions about that but one thing i do is if i get sweet tea in the bottom of my my cup and you take your first drink of tea with a straw it's all sweet and that's not what you want you want it to be mixed up and so one thing i do is i'll blow bubbles to try to you know kind of like you would oxygenate a pond right you want to flip the water and you've explained to me how a pond can flip and all the carbon dioxide just comes out of the pond instantly and it kills all the fish in the pond that's what oxygenating the water is important so there are some efforts to you know have pumps where they have tubes down and pipes down to the bottom of the of the pond or that it's a it's a lake excuse me to try to flip the water it's not natural but it's a really really difficult thing and there's a volcanic element to this too right yeah yeah that that's we don't know what the relationship is but just looking at it here it looks like these lakes are somehow related to this this weird little chain of volcanic activity i didn't know existed that just runs right up through the corner of Africa looks like it runs right there in that little spot between equatorial guinea camaroon and nigeria and on up a ways into the continent of a 45 degree angle running southwest to northeast looks like all of these death lakes are in proximity of a volcano but it also looks like nobody knows exactly how the volcano is contributing to this buildup that's my quick summary of what i'm saying so interestingly this is a thing that happened we know it happens we can try to prevent it in the future that's a tragedy right and we we should try to prevent that in the future which brings me to what i would propose we end the episode on because we as you decided to arrange this fantastic topic thank you so much for coming up with this topic dude this is thanks for playing ball yeah brilliant so you decided to order this in order of tragedy okay how many people died i have one in the future that we need to think about there is another one of these death lakes in rowanda it's called lake kiwu k i v u okay lake kiwu is another one of these death lakes it's even worse than like nayos because not only does it have carbon dioxide and saturation at the bottom of the lake it also has methane oh so you can literally google videos of lake kiwu burning and it happens like you can see people in this village right there on the side of lake kiwu and it's like on fire and you're like what are you serious right yes the lake is actually on fire it's insane so this has got to sit right on that east african rift that has to be what's fueling it right it's it's right on the border with with the kongo and um so here's the thing two million people live on the shores of this lake whoa it is so much bigger than lake nayos it is incredibly large two million the largest lake in africa just like just looked it up is it really 2700 kilometers squared okay so that's a time bomb so i i'm not saying this is going to happen but what i what i am saying is people are worried about it because it has the same physical properties as lake nayos this lake nayos disaster happened in 1986 right it doesn't often enough where we're like oh yeah let's don't build there you're trying to settle in area you walk up you're like man it's a gigantic body of water obviously this is where i'm going to put my village right well sure they've done some core samples at the bottom of lake kiwu which is very deep by the way and uh at this maximum depth it's over 1500 feet deep they have found in the strata several different mass extinction events that have happened at the lake whoa so they don't know when it happens it happens on the order of thousands of years and period but the problem is it's settled now there are millions of people that live on the banks of lake kiwu in fact there is a company they're like okay this is a problem and there's a company that now generates power from the methane i think it's the it's called kiwu watt k i v u w a t t and so they there's a company that has pipes going down to the bottom of the lake and somehow they separate out the methane from the water like just straight up from the water in the lake they separate it out and then they generate power using the methane but my question is wow is lake kiwu at risk of having a massive desaturation event so to speak basically the lake burping and we have a huge like absolutely huge flood of carbon dioxide and this time methane again and this time it could kill millions of people in rewanda that's my question i don't know i don't know the answer but i know that i'm concerned about it and people are thinking about it and clearly work shopping solutions and if one of the solutions provides power to an economically depressed part of the world while reducing the likelihood of a cataclysmic event i gotta say hey bravo to your field good job engineers that's amazing you said earlier that lake kiwu was one you did not say it was the largest lake you said it's one of the largest lakes in africa right six six yeah okay got it mhm man this is uh this was an interesting topic dude i i appreciate you taking me down this rabbit hole i kind of want to go to lake kiwu and check it out i kind of do too yeah it's kind of like talking about war though right and then let me put a bow on it this way this is how i think about it talking about war is really interesting the history of warfare what people used each technological advance to get ahead of the last person i mean heck we play video games about it this is basically the plot of civilization yeah yeah we're learning about like uh flight and philosophy and stuff but ultimately that game comes down to yeah but what weapon can i stab people with next warfare is very dark it guts societies it's incredibly expensive it is not sexy it is one of the really unfortunate expressions of what it is to be human and live on this planet we just cannot seem to get this right we get worked up and we kill people it's a huge problem also it's fascinating to think about not just the battlefield mechanics and all of that it's fascinating to think about the psychology of that what would it be like to be engaged in ancient persian greek style warfare we just got a mass of people a flood of humans coming at you with eight and ten foot spears covered by shields and well your betters have decided we're going to handle that with archery and they are moving inside our arc of fire uh they're getting real close guys i can't even shoot arrows at them now at this range i don't have an angle what's plan here what's the plan i mean the psychological pressure of that moment that these historical oddball outlier non-typical floods and i would include even ancient battlefield tactics in that the psychological aspect of that it takes you to a whole new place in terms of the human experience that's very difficult to empathize with because it is so entirely foreign and once you get past the joke and the fun of like a beer went everywhere because beer people drink it and get drunk it so funny once you get past that and into what you would do if you saw a wall of beer coming at you while you were mourning the recent death of your two-year-old child i don't know it takes you to kind of the outer limits of what it is to be a person and to be a person who's in constant battle with a physical environment that ultimately wants to kill you and ultimately is going to win for me there's hope in that we can learn lessons and and so i think that as an engineer the fact that we now know more about the manganese content and steel and how it's important to get that right and also make the the wall thickness of your vats thicker because of these things we can learn the lesson but unfortunately someone had to learn the lesson and a lot of those rules are written in blood or in this case you know suffocation so i think learning the lessons from the past and trying to figure out how to improve on them and reduce human suffering moving forward there's not a Hippocratic oath in engineering i wish there was something similar that was like you know hey you know i'm going to do things to help people i think the reason there's not a Hippocratic oath in my field is because engineers make wars happen so and and you know myself included right so i think it's interesting to think about all the lessons that we can learn here and and try to make things better for future generations and i did not expect that when you had me research things about non-water floods i thought i was going to joke about sticky molasses stuck in your basement but uh it took me to weird places and i really appreciate the topic yeah i appreciate your optimistic note i agree and i think anytime we experience human empathy that's just a win even if it's human empathy over dark stories and difficult things because that's part of the human experience too lots of lessons to be learned about what to do and how to manage things but also lots of things to explore and knowing ourselves and knowing the people we love and how we're wired and how we face down the the really big stuff so thanks for doing a weird episode with me man and thanks for putting in a ton of work too i know you did did your homework and that made it all that much more fun it was a great topic thanks for thinking about it", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start":
