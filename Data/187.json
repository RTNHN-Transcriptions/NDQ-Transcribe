Okay, good So you went you took your daughter to a mountain top experience like an actual top of the mountain experience Yeah, like almost a mountain top the intent was for it to be a mountain top But we got kind of tired so we just got close and called it good Did you really long ways up there at an altitude that would be confusing for somebody like you but we did it It was pretty good. I'm sorry. I'll stop teasing you I know you try and I know you have a story you want to tell me and I'm looking forward to that Yeah, I'm sure it was great. We went to the big horns in Wyoming, which are Pretty big mountains. I mean it's the Rocky Mountain West You could argue that the big horns are the first Rocky Mountain range that you come to if you're going from East to West across the United States You could kind of argue that the black Hills where we live are that but they're a lot lower The black Hills top out a little under 8,000 feet the big horns get up the you know 13,000 ish So it's it's quite a ways up there a long time ago. So being from the south You know, we're we're basically a warm ocean down here We have all the atmospheric pressure a boy could want 14.7 psi Or if your navigation 29.92 inches of mercury, but we would is that a lot? That's just one standard atmospheres what that is sea level. Yeah 101 325 Pascal's That I just for some reason back in the day I just memorized a bunch of units of standard atmosphere 1760 tour I think I could be wrong about one of these but anyway We just have all the air you could ever want here and I remember a long time ago a buddy of mine and I we went out to Business trip to Colorado and before the meeting in Boulder We said man, I hear there's a lot of mountains out here. Do you want to go like hike one? Oh, there's a little hiking trail Let's just go do it and we decided to go hiking in Boulder Which my understanding is the beginning of the mountains is that true? Yeah, there's a little range that is called the flat irons that is right there behind Boulder It's a subset of what's called the front range Which is most of the mountains that you see when you drive along the where the plains become the mountains of Colorado? Generally you're looking at the front range and the flat irons are a little chunk of that kind of nestled back in there in Boulder Well, what I know is I was in my 20s and when you're in your 20s you're invincible. You can do anything but we started hiking up this little walking trail and My heart was a flutter and like a hummingbird and I had no idea why And I just I was like what is going on? I'm very very tired and I don't know why and It's altitude, right? Yeah, and it's a thing Now you of course of the two of us have been more exposed to altitude deprivation the highest altitude I've ever been at on land that I walked to or drove to is 14,000 and change I've been up to the top of a few mountains in Colorado that are north of 14,000 feet Yeah, you really feel it I got altitude sickness once on Holy Cross Which is the name of a mountain in central Colorado and I got right up to the top and I had to come down Couldn't get it fixed and as I descended my heart felt better and my stomach felt better And it just went away just needed more oxygen. I just didn't manage the ascent quite properly. I guess I don't know. I don't really know how you avoid it But for the most part what I feel when I go up really high goofing around the mountains growing up or even now is I just get tired faster and What I found on this trip that I took with my daughter was at any time I squatted down like in a catcher's stance to Set up tent or fiddle with equipment. I would get really lightheaded after about 30 seconds of that whereas normally I could remain in that position for a real long time Just that little deprivation of circulation because my knees were kinked. Yeah. Yeah I would really notice it and when I stood up I'd need to put a hand on something for a second just to steady myself when we were at you know above 10,000 feet Did you let her know? Oh heck? Yeah, okay. Yeah, she gets to know my weakness. Okay, that's good I mean as part of her learning about life is she gets to know what my limitations are and she gets to get a sense of which of those limitations are a result of just how life is and which are a result of I'm in my 40s and so your body changes and Something's are harder. Let me ask you something you took your daughter up on this trip to a mountain. Mm-hmm Why mountains? Hmm To me it feels like you and I have talked about this recently, but I've been using the word ordeal a lot lately If you watch any movie that involves a hero, they will squeeze through a tight place. They will be reborn They will punch up through dirt. They will Be submerged in water and go through an ordeal while in the water They will go to a mountain and meet with something or experience Something in an environment hostile and foreign to them and the pain of being in that hostile environment whether it's underwater or sub-terranean or up on a mountain is The ordeal it is what awakens the next chapter in the life of the hero And there's a reason every story forever dating back to the oldest versions of stories We know in the world Have this Transformative moment look for it in any movie you watch Any movie with a hero will have the moment of the ordeal the moment of rebirth Something happens and you're not the same after that Why a mountain with my daughter? Because I want to be there for one of those moments of rebirth. I was there for the first one her middle name means rebirth I Wanted to be there for it. I wanted to see what would happen when we got in that environment And I wanted her to see me going through change that happens when you go through an ordeal So we picked an ordeal and we went through it together But why do it like what why go through the pain? Because I'm not what I want to be Because I don't want to become a thing and then be that on cruise control until I die one day It's almost like the pain does something the challenge of going up there is important So I guess it's not immediately clear just talking with the third chair here about why there's less oxygen at altitude How would you explain that huh? I Don't know that's weird. I've never really thought about that before but I just know that when you go up There's less air and you can feel it and it's a phenomenon that I've been used to for so long Being a kid growing up in Colorado that I've just accepted it, but I've never thought about why okay? Here's my guess you I mean you may know the answer to this you maybe just playing with me. Here's my guess the more The atmosphere has a compressive effect. It looks like it's nothing, but it actually has weight mm-hmm and the more weight that is stacked on top of breathable air and I understand that's a Compound there's a variety of elements in air But the more weight that gets stacked upon it the more compressed that air becomes and as a result The air I breathe is more oxygen saturated When I am at sea level the further up I go the less weight there is Compressing it down and as a result it's not as oxygen saturated. I just made that up You can now make fun of me. Of course. I won't make fun of you I like to think of it like this and this is a very very backwards way of thinking about it The easy way to say it is like oh well like imagine a column of air between you in space and like the higher you go There's less air on top, but I like to think about it backwards. So imagine Wait, yeah, can I amend my answer? Yeah, okay What about this theory number two and I'm just making crap up? What if it's like okay? You ever drink from a cup that has a severe taper like the top is really really wide But the base of the cup is very narrow. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah when you're filling that It fills to the 50% mark in terms of just its height It feels very quickly because there isn't there isn't as much space to fill with the liquid But then as it goes up the majority of the liquid in the cup is at the top because it's it's kind of conical an inverted cone sort of And maybe there's just more real estate the further away you get from the planet because the atmosphere Space is bigger up there than it is down here So maybe the oxygen just spreads out there. That's my second guess now. I have two guesses Man, that's that's an interesting you thinking about the geometry of a sphere as you move away That's that's very interesting and I want to I want to talk about that and assess code for wrong Well, no, but think about this you've used a logging chain before right? We like to look a ball something heavy. Yeah, like a huge chain, right? Yeah, you just wrap around on itself and it binds up and you can drag something huge Imagine in our minds eye imagine we're gonna take a chain and We're going to pick it up from the end. It's it's coiled up on the ground and we're gonna pick it up and we pick up one link and Then we pick up two links and we're picking up the chain and as we pick up the chain We're picking up more links, right? Sure. Say there's a hundred links to this chain If I grab it from link one and pick it up I have to support the weight of all 100 links of that chain correct of course Assuming you're very tall. Yeah, whatever the weight of that link is it's that times a hundred now if I were to take that and I were to go down and I were to cut the chain and pick up 50 of those links then the chain would weigh half as much right Yes And so the closer to the ground I get and like let's say I just cut it down to like two links that the lower The amount of weight is I like to think of that for some reason holding a rope I think about the weight of the rope a lot But for some reason I in my brain there's a bucket where I think about the additive properties of mass and gravity and all this kind of stuff And it's in the same bucket the reason there's more oxygen down low than up high It's in the same bucket there. So imagine you're at the bottom of a swimming pool You've got the water Like you're laying on the bottom of the swimming pool the pressure in Pounds per square inch that is exerted on your body is going to be a function of how deep you are in the swimming pool Sure, right and so the deeper you go you ever swam to the bottom of a pool and you feel your ears wanting to pop Oh, yeah, of course, that's all it is but air that's the reason that down at sea level We have fourteen point seven pounds per square inch on our bodies or one atmosphere pressure But if you go higher You have less pressure because you have less air above you in the swimming pool so to speak Sure. So why does that make there be less oxygen that I get to breathe because the air is less dense Right because if the pressure is lower higher that means let's say I take a breath right here in Alabama And let's say I breathe in I'm at about 600 to 700 feet of altitude above sea level right here Let's have breathe that in why I'm breathing really soupy thick air down here Yeah, what's your outcome now? I'm going to breathe in at about 3,000 feet, okay? So still pretty good, but it didn't feel as satisfying as your breath didn't feels as good No, I could just tell yeah, cuz I'm lower in the swimming pool the pool being the atmosphere and the gases You have more gas below you than I do well, you know I've got a lot of gas above me and so it's it's pressurized But that means the air is denser where I am so for every breath I take I'm getting more oxygen because there might be a million molecules in my breath and there might be 700,000 in yours. I have no idea what the numbers would be Does it make sense? It does and it raises another question for me, okay over the course of the last 15 years I would say I have lived at an average altitude of 5,000 feet. Why was it 6,000 feet roughly in Wyoming? I've been around 3,000 feet here in South Dakota all in between so I'm just ballpark and let's say 5,000 feet You have lived at an average altitude of 600 feet for that same period of time because you've been in the same place. Yes, yeah Over the course of a lifetime That means Let's just project project that out over 90 years and say we lived at that average altitude for 90 years each How much additional weight have you carried around over your 90 years? Compared to my 90 years Simply as a function of where you live versus where I live because there's actual weight to it. Oh wow in the moment It doesn't matter but over 90 years like have you lifted 10 tons more than me Have you lifted 100 tons more than me? Have you lifted one pound more than me? I don't know but I'm curious Oh my goodness, that's interesting. So if I were to do a free body diagram of the forces on my body I have the weight of my body But I also have whatever my surface area of my feet are times the atmospheric pressure where I'm at Wow, I've never thought about that. That's awesome So if I were to be right here If I were somehow be able to transport myself instantly between here and where you live and we had an absolute scale So if we just had a cylinder of steel And I put it here and then I take it to where you are and I put it there Would that mean that they would weigh different with a way different because I mean I think you would be As a stop it. It's gonna depend on the footprint, right? It's got to when you do the rocket equation There's a an area component of it and it involves the atmospheric Pressure on the the back of the rocket. That's interesting. Okay. Cool. Okay. So let's imagine let's imagine instead of a cylinder Yeah, imagine a gong. Okay It's three feet in diameter I suspect there is some altitude at which You could go from sea level up to a certain altitude and you could have scales Precise enough to measure the reduced weight at altitude Like you take that thing, you know to base camp at Everest and you're at 20,000 feet almost Versus sea level or death valley even below sea level The dead sea Like there's got to be an instrument that would be precise enough to tell the difference in weight because there's so much surface area At a relatively lightweight that's being knocked down there the surface area of the scale itself would matter Oh Yeah, so I don't think you I don't think you could take that into account because the scale face itself It would feel that pressure What a fascinating problem There has to be a way to do this there has to be a way to measure the scale. I also have another dumb question that's similar to this Okay, like all right if you think about the the earth moon system Is there a scale precise enough to measure Like if I were just to measure a ball and the the moon is going around the earth when the moon is directly overhead Does it pull on the the ball just a little bit versus the moon is on the other side of the world? I've always thought about that too. I mean, it's the size of a continent. Yeah, yeah, it has to right Gravity it does. I mean, maybe it's just so far away that it doesn't factor in these are really fun things to think about They're really fun things to think about and I literally never have Yeah, it's interesting. I just grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado and we would drive up highway 14 or highway 34 And go way up into the high country We would drive above timberline all the time we didn't have money growing up, but we could afford gas And so mom and dad would just take us on mountain drives all the time we go play up in the mountains And so you just know you into it the when the foliage looks a certain way Yeah, we're about this elevation now. It looks this way. Uh we're about this elevation Now there are no more trees. Oh we're about this elevation And you kind of learn this is what it's going to feel like to run and frolic and play in each of those places So there's absolutely no science to it for me until this moment just kind of Intuition and what you're raised around it's interesting you bring up the different I don't know which call those those zones of vegetation biomes What is it? Biomes. Yeah, because I don't know where we went. I experienced different biomes. You did Oh, yeah, I'm eager to hear what it is that you did. Yeah, like maybe there's um There's like a hill full of trash. Yeah, your local landfill exactly and they pushed a bunch of dirt over it And you went all the way up to like 700 feet. That's right. I'm excited about it. Yeah, I'm not going to patronize you I do want to hear about your thing. I'm sure it was adorable. Okay. I'm here. Yeah, sorry Your adventure with your Meaningful and transformative to go to the top of that covered over landfill pit there in northern, Alabama I'm sure it was great. And you must have been very tired. We'll talk about that so tired We went up in the big horns and it was really lovely It was very moussey tons and tons and tons of moose Which is cool because the moose thinned out in Wyoming for a while in the 20 teens There was some sort of moose wasting disease and now the mooses seem to be doing a lot better There were a lot of mooses moose wasting disease I do I made up a name like I've heard of fish wasting disease So I just sort of applied it to moose, but there was something that was when I first moved to Wyoming There were moose everywhere and we saw like 60 our first summer there And then by the time we left I would only see five And I'm in the mountains all the time. I'm fishing and driving and living in the mountains They just thinned out. I don't know as locals had guesses as to what happened And all the hunters kind of know they've all got a sense of how many of each species are kind of out there How all the herds are doing when it comes to the elk And it just it was really cool to see so many moose and see them kind of bouncing back This is a rabbit trail. I don't want to go down right now But I do want to just say something You said moose wasting disease and that put a red flag in my mind Because there is a disease in Alabama right now. It just came into Alabama It's called cwd chronic wasting disease. Okay, and it affects the deer population Okay, what's causing it is terrifying It's a prion. Do you know what a prion is? Is sounds like an alien from dr. Who? Uh, yeah might as well be so a prion It's a protein that's folded abnormally doesn't have dna is my understanding. I don't know a lot about this but it will infect the deer And then the deer will just walk around Not quite like rabies, but it'll just go crazy And it'll just waste away And supposedly These prions don't affect humans But it terrifies me and we need to talk about that another time with someone that's educated on the subject because i'm not So it zombifies deer. Yes Yes, we have billboards up in Alabama saying hey If you kill a deer we need to know because we need to see if cwd is spreading Like it's a thing man Like if you just look up deer cwd map You look up chronic wasting disease is cwd in your state And um, it's a thing so it looks like it's starting. Oh wow. It looks like it actually started in Wyoming Dang it. Yeah, you have it and it's spreading. I don't have it This has been a relatively cohesive conversation It started in Colorado then went to Wyoming and it's spreading all over the country and uh, it came to Alabama last year So it's a thing so I wonder if it manifests in all ungulates and you guys just mostly have deer there I guess that's how it shows up. I got kicked in the ungulates one time. I'm not really sure That was me after you rocketed me in the ungulates with that paddle. Are we talking about the same thing? What? What are we now? Huh? Why is this like this? Now anyway, so so there were moose up there and they weren't wasting that's great. Yeah, it was really cool and big bull moose Like really big one of them Uh super fun. We were hiking our goal was to make it up to bomber mountain. We're during world war two a bomber crashed and the crew sadly perished But if you could see where it is you'd understand why nobody just went up there and pulled out a bomber It's not exactly extractable it isn't up there for posterity It's up there because it would be cost prohibitive to try to get it out and very dangerous. It's way way way up there Almost 30,000 feet. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, uh, it's right next to cloud peak Which I think is the high point of the the big horn range And so there are two bomber crashes in yoming from the world war two era One is over closer to the national parks yellow stone and teton Near the little town of doubois not doubois doubois. There's a whole story behind that as well And so i've been up into that little canyon where a bomber crashed there And then we got close but did not make it all the way up to the side of the bomber crash over the big horn So it's cool. Like it's you know, it's a thing you go see the two bombers Women up we fished a bunch. We camped. It was super buggy. It was beautiful I dived into a mountain lake to cool off after a day of hiking It was just delightful and looked so deep but the water was so clear that it was deceptive. Oh wow I dived or dove. I never know which one it's divan you divan divan divanated into the water I just felt amazing after this hot day And I thought I got all kinds of room here to splash and kick around So I did a big scissor kick And Absolutely gouged myself on this super sharp rock Way up high in the mountains And I don't know. I don't know if you'll be able to see it. It's kind of hard to see but It's right just all the way down this side. Oh wow right there And so that was that was painful that made for a bit of an adventure and you had to hike stand what altitude was that at like That happened at about 10 about 10,000. Okay, and you were still going up at that point Uh, we were hanging out at that point We had a base camp and we went up from there and then came back down Yeah, you know, there were just fun adventures like that You want to get a little bit of hurt. You want to fall into some water You want to see some wildlife you want to have a little scare and have to figure things out We ran into a giant bull moose Right on the trail. That's right where we needed to go And it was super fun to problem solve that together Because it's easy when you look at a satellite map to be like, well, just walk around it Well, yeah, but when you're actually there most of that's impassable except for the trail And so we had to figure out How to get around this moose who was not moving and was very attentive to us While not falling off of a cliff or getting stuck in a bog where we couldn't flee the moose if it became angry and pursued us But also we needed to get back down the mountain while it was still daylight to our stuff So we had to work out a clever plan to outfox and out maneuver this monster That was in our path on the trail and this is great. This is super super fun What was the point of the trip? Like what were you hoping to do or What did you want to happen? I wanted to lightly introduce things that are hard I wanted her to go to a place where there's absolutely no service or contact with the outside world at all Where everything you need to survive you have to carry in and then there's no trash and no burning So you have to carry every bit of your waste back out They don't even let you poop in the woods up there You got to bring a little bag full of lie or chemical and Crap in a bag and then drag it back out with you It really puts you in touch with what it takes to be a person and what it takes to get by I just want to talk about her future and what she has in mind for what's next and I Think we accomplished that. I think it was a really nice time. That's awesome And you and you think you accomplished what you were after it was cool. I mean we caught some fish We saw beautiful things and We adjusted our plan on the fly. I could tell after the hike in which was pretty intense and we overpacked a little bit She was pretty worn down That from base camp to the top of the mountain was going to be a little bit of a tall order So we hiked up a long ways well above timberline and we fished and We looked at where we might have walked to and we called it good instead of making it a miserable thing for her Where dad is yelling and forcing her and pep talking her to the top but now she hurts and hates the outdoors forever We went until right when it made sense Hung out had a picnic and then went back down after outboxing a moose. So was it I think it's smart to do that. How many nights in the woods did you spend? Three nights in the woods. That's legit man And your career country like that that's different That yeah, we had the bear spray on the hip and it's grizzly country So you can bring a firearm, but it's a really heavy firearm If you want to try to discourage a bear and everybody I know who has had any kind of armed confrontation with a grizzly Comes away saying the same thing. You think it's so big and that you're just going to hit it like in the movies But you don't It's just Unbelievably hard to hit a bear when it's running at you So I decided that the value equation wasn't worth it for the massive weight of a big gun So we just loaded up on a bunch of bears spray and we had no issues. We didn't see any bears or anything It worked just fine. That's awesome. He still had to out out maneuver the the natural world, which is fun It was really fun. Yeah, and I caught a trout. I've never seen before What kind is it a spider fire? I'm trying to think of the name of the trout. It's a rainbow whisker What is it yellow-throated warbler trout? Yes, that's what it is Is it a I think it's a spike. I think it's something called a spike It has a an eyeball that sits up way high on its head It kind of looks like a sauger if you've ever seen one of those And it has a few hints of markings that look like a brook trout But also a little bit like a rainbow and a little bit like a lake trout And also it has a wormy pattern on the top like a tiger trout tiger Yeah, I'm sitting here looking at a picture of it online. It it's crazy. It's goofy, right? Yeah, that's interesting Yeah, so I got a bunch of pictures of it I still haven't had total confirmation that that's what I got But if so, that was my first Splayk, which I think is a brook trout lake trout combination. I think that's right. That was pretty fun too Hey, this episode of no dumb questions is brought to you by the people who support this program the patrons of the program We call them the wing tasars Who support the program at patreon.com slash no dumb questions And we did a thing a while back where we reached out to A handful of people at random who support the program and asked if they would do what's of the kindness Of recording a little bit telling us why they support the program and then figured we would share it with you So I've got one here. I haven't heard it yet. We'll hear it together right now Hey y'all. My name is chanson from akins. I trail hanna and i've been supporting the podcast since fall of 2017 I primarily support the podcast because I admire your authenticity and willingness to commit to your families and products greater than yourselves And secondarily i'm holding on to the hope that us patrons eventually get an uncensored version of that one episode where your buddy lee swears a whole bunch Have a great day So anyways, uh, you know, it's a pretty big adventure pretty great accomplishment because i'm a man of the west and I do Really hard things, but you went on a hike in a local park or did something you've been kind of coy about it I wanted to hear about your little thing. So what did you do? Yeah, you're funny and you know, I did we we hiked kill them in jaro in africa Uh, yes, so that's in africa. Yeah, and uh, it rises like a limpus above the sarin getty It does it's huge. What is the total altitude of that summit? I was 19,341 feet Okay, I want to stop you before you tell me too much about this and ruin it. I think this story is going to be way better If as i'm asking questions, you're walking me through it. You do not tip your hand as to whether You all or you specifically made it to the top But let me let the third chair Find out when we get there as to what happened at the end of this And how it actually went down in the moment of truth is that okay? It is I will tell you this leading into that without tipping my hand 17,000 feet Is where the brain starts to struggle I'll just say that it's pretty uniform 17,000 feet is when it gets real. You know, I've I prepared a couple times before I left You would call me. I was in the gem where in the bane mask. It was like a oxygen restriction mask Hello My targeting smart ever do yes, so basically wearing a mask that you have to breathe through a little restrictive orifice and doing like all the the stair stepper machine Time you wanted at the gem and it was just like grinding it out trying to train my body to behave Well with lack of oxygen because that's the big thing when you get up around that altitude They say it's like rolling the dice You know, there's a good chance you're just not going to do well And so a lot of people have problems and so we as a team there were 15 of us My buddy He was turning 50 and he's kind of the big idea friend and he said hey I'm thinking about hike and kill manjaro for my 50th. What do you think? And I was like holy moly That's That's a thing right there. He does a lot of work in africa works with some schools and stuff over there like man, that's a thing and so I was kind of like kind of doing the math on it after the fact he wanted his wife to go His wife wanted friends to go with her So tara was going to go and support her and I was kind of thrown in the mix. You know what I mean? Oh boy. I was like a bonus friend and so we all went there were 15 of us that went to hike killing andjaro What was the age range? Uh, so my daughter went my oldest daughter went she was probably the youngest She's 17 So she was the youngest there were three other kids that went And then I think that there was a couple in there like 57 ish age group Wow, and but they're like hyper fit. They're incredibly fit When did you find out you were going to do this trip? How many months before you took the trip? Probably around eight or something like that. We we made the decision. It's a what thing man It was a long you just didn't mention this No, because I knew that you were going maybe six weeks before you left Yeah, it just didn't come up when we talked multiple times every day You never occurred to you. Your life is so interesting That you were like, I don't know. I wouldn't want to bore you with this killin andjaro Life-changing Transformative or deal of a trip where I come out a different person than I was but I just yeah, I didn't want to bother with it Well, I mean, well, there's a lot to it number one It felt weird because you know when you go to all these people that go to hike Mount Everest Which is more than a Denver above killin andjaro. Yes people hike and they have sharpas They hire a guide And they hire sharpas to help them get to the top So part of the deal that we wanted to do we knew that we were not capable mountaineers Like we know this going in So my buddy did a lot of research there's gonna be 15 people going and the reason we had to do 15 Is because that made the price come down and there was like different price breaks And so 15 of us went and we knew we were gonna have to have a guide and we were gonna have to have orders And Nepal the people that help you are called sharpas And kill manjaro Tanzania the people that help you are called orders We knew we were gonna have to have order support and So we we found this outfit called killi warriors There's a ton of different people that offer this service their guide services But the one we went with they were called killi warrior expeditions And I have to say they were Ridiculously professional. I mean the experience was incredible real quick back up to the training How many sessions of training did you put in before you went total number probably Eight in the stair stepper But one thing we did do is we try to spend time with our family every year We try to do some type of trip or something where we spend time with the kids And this year we looked at the map of the us and we're like, okay kill manjaro is 19 000 and change feet We know that a lot of people will get to like 17 000 feet And they will just get punched by altitude sickness and there's nothing you can do about it It doesn't matter how fit you are It doesn't matter if you're like a marathon runner some people just they they're incredibly fit But like martha and they would be fine the next day. Yeah, exactly. It's just that day I've had it happen literally once and only once but when it hit me it was embarrassing I'm from colorado. I should be able to do this. I've done it before I've done it recently But there was no rhyme or reason to it and the only way to fix it I tried to gut it out the only way to fix it was to go down. So yeah, it happens Yeah, I mean one of the things people were telling us they were like, hey martha stewart Like the cooking lady on tv She made it up kill manjaro and then they list off these famous athletes that haven't made it up kill They tried and they didn't because they got hit by altitude sickness So We knew we needed to eliminate that factor if we could Tera and I planned out a trip. We're like, hey, we need to go to the highest altitude in the us We can for a reasonable amount of money We went to colorado That was the highest we could get we rented an air B&B and we went to bracken ridge And and not in ski season We did it in off season and then we went up there and then we went and there were some 14 000 foot mountains there Yeah, and we we tried to hike one but the storm got us much like your experience So we we hiked to about 13 000 a little over 13 000 feet That's phenomenal. It was pretty significant like we could tell where like man our brains aren't working like normal And that was at 13 000 feet and you know what that feels like because you did the oxygen deprivation chamber Yeah, and you were unable to identify shapes Yeah, absolutely. So at 25 000 feet, which is when I did the video with nasa called why you should put your mask on first We went to fl 250 which means 25 000 feet altitude I went hypoxic at 25 000 feet Meaning the alveoli or alveoli Basically the little fuzzy receptors in your lungs. Yeah, the alveoli in my lungs They weren't able to keep up the equation to keep my brain functioning properly and I went hypoxic And when they pulled the hair out of that chamber, I just like whoo I just went loopy I was concerned about that because I was like that's 25 000 feet And we're going to 19 and a half ish It's like that's not that much difference. So I was I was pretty concerned. So we went to colorado We did some test hikes. It's one thing to be at that altitude It's quite another to do physical activity at that altitude like you said Yeah, so we practiced that and we did okay my wife my daughter and I we did fine But we were certainly very tired then we went to pikes peak. There's a railway Which is like the coolest mechanical engineering thing i've ever seen the what's it called the cog railway? I think that's right. Yeah You had a little miniature version of that in hurricane creek state park Between you know kind of going south down toward bermingham, right? You have It doesn't operate anymore, but there was a little cog rail. Yep that used to run up and down to the bottom of that canyon there Yeah, it's so cute. Yeah, and there's no way you could get me on that thing now It's only like a hundred feet, but it's it's scary So yeah, absolutely. We we went up the incline railway up to pikes peak And we could feel it at pikes peak at 14 000 and some change where we're like man. This is crazy My family got oddly emotional at that altitude like we we drove up mount evans in calorado On our little trip and we're going around a curve and you know the curves at the top of these mountains You're just so scary when you're driving. You know, it's like oh, whoa is the car slipping? What's happening? You know just being funny Yes, dad Instantly like multiple people in the car started crying like tears Whoa They're like what this is not funny. Yeah, just are were you repentant or oh, I'm really like I did science and I got results Yeah, I'm like so sorry. I'm sorry everyone that was it when we what are the little animals that you have up at altitude? We permit what are they? Marmot Marmot we call them mountain beavers They'll yell a bellied marmot. Yeah, well, they're mountain beavers without the floppy tail Oh, yeah, what's with marmot's dude? What is that? I don't know. I shot one in the heart once Did you really? Yes, was it warmet season? No, it wasn't marmot season my dog got into a fight with a marmot And they just both went crazy and my dog got the black eyes of death And my wife was throwing furniture at the marmot like off of the deck shriek again. You stop it. You stop Camilla was throwing yes No, she's throwing like tables and chairs like a whole yard sale just heaving it off of the deck Trying to hit the dog so the dog and the marmot will stop fighting But marmot's are big man. The marmot said why believe the american west during this wild with I cannot Get the gun Really I go down there and trying to you know separate the animals. I'm like well I'm probably it's a good idea. I have a gun. I'm probably gonna have to put one of these animals down And I don't want it to be either of them, but if it's got to be one I want it to be the mountain beaver so go down there and And uh my pup won but they were both a mess idiots and It's like well I don't have any ear protection or anything. So I have to put down the marmot. I Love animals. I don't kill fish. I don't eat fish. I put them all back carefully in pains taking I don't like this man, but that that poor little fella was done for would the mountain beaver taste like I Ask the coyotes So I had to do the thing where I covered my left ear with my shoulder. I hate that and then uh Try to cover your right ear with your yeah Or I'm covering my right ear with my shoulder my shooting hand and plugging my left ear with my finger I could have gone. I got ear protection, but I want to just relieve this poor And so like you're trying to you're trying to aim when you got your head caught to the side You're not a good shot in that situation. That's hard to do And so obviously there's a way to put down an animal And I missed from two feet away because of the way I had everything all kinked up and I Yeah, I didn't I took it took two rounds for me to Mercy kill the injured marmot. This is just the way of the mountains man I know this is going to sound horrifying to a lot of people in the third chair There's wild animals everywhere Crap happens. I don't know so then my neighbor comes out And he's like, what are you what are you doing? But he wasn't even upset and he's like well obviously if matt needs to shoot something There's a dang good reason So I'm like, uh, yeah A marmot got up on the deck and then my dog pushed out the door because he's freaking out And they fought and wrestled and bloodied each other and they fought all the way down the hill They fought across the road and they fought across your property This is where I finally caught up with them and the marmot was done for so I I finished it off I was like you want me to just take a shovel and go bury it back up on my property And he's like, no just throw it behind my gravel pile the coyotes will love it So, okay So those the coyotes uh Cleaned up the marmot and this is the way of nature Hards though it sounds it's true. So you saw some of those. Did you shoot any of them didn't shoot a single mountain baver? No, we did they fight any of your kids they did not but we We liked it here in swig they were squeaky and we we liked yelling at the mountain beavers It was great. So we went out to Colorado We made sure that we were clear and acclimated to the the altitude And one of the things that I realized really quick is I constantly wanted to know my altitude when we were in Colorado How did you track it? What did you use to keep track of that? Uh, Tara had an app on her phone, but it wasn't accurate. Hmm. I realized we're going to be in africa We're not going to be able to charge our stuff I need a way to measure altitude And there's two ways you can measure altitude one of them was by pressure by barometric pressure Now the problem with barometric pressure remember we were talking about the column of air above you Yeah, so if I have a barometer and I just go up in altitude the pressure is going to go down And because we know the specific weight of air You can figure out how high you are based on the barometric pressure and that's why there has to be wiggle room to that because Barometric pressure changes based on climate activity exactly and that's why every aviator Let's say i'm going to fly into the rapid city south of kota airport I'm going to call in and i'm going to let me be like hey Rapid city. This is br 549. I'm coming in. You know, I'd like to request whatever and they would say okay cool And they would give you Yes, the weather and so there's usually a different frequency from mitar where you get the weather and it goes the winds are 150, you know, and they tell you the direction and magnitude of the winds And they also tell you the barometric pressure And when they tell you the barometric pressure you set in the old school way Is you reach up to your dash on an airplane and you turn a little dial on what's called the colesman window? So they'll say 29.5 2 That is exactly the made up stop Stop i'm stopping that is precisely to the hundredth What the made up hypothetical barometric pressure i was about to reel off to you in this question was going to be really 29.5 2 that was the number i was formulating my question So so what what that says if if you at rapid city south kota airport says hey, okay i'm sitting here on the runway Barometric pressure is 29.5 2 What that tells me is there's a lot of math that has to happen if i say the altitude of rapid city airport is 3 000 feet Msl or whatever it is a little lower, but sure yeah if i say this is the altitude and this is the pressure I can set my barometer calibration in my airplane to 29.5 2 and i know that when i get 29.5 2 i'm going to be at 3 000 feet elevation So that's the way they take into account the You go backwards. I was already mind blown now i'm double mind blown When they give you that 29.5 2 that's ground level i mean that's what you're going to measure That's why your weather stuffs at the airport that's at the location of the application of the the instrument okay or the the runway they're co located And so you know based on all the the vfr charts all the aviator maps You know where the runway is And you know what the barometric pressure is there and so throughout the day That automated system that's blasting out the weather information at an airport It may have five different weather reports What you'll do is they'll have this automated and you can do this just go listen to any airport metar thing You can actually call a phone number and listen to it. Let's call one here. I'll just pull it up. Give me a second. Yeah, let's do it What do we do rapid city rapid city metar uh Phone number Okay, wrap in that adore rapid city. Okay. Okay. Fire away. What is it? Uh weather asos. It's six oh five 393 2832 here we go The altitude 5300 I City Regional Airport automated weather observation 1 9 or 4 8 zulu wind 360 at 2 4 heat gusts 37 visibility 1 0 Sky condition clear temperature to 8 Celsius 2.15 Celsius Altimeter 301 0 remarks density altitude 5300 Rapid City Regional Airport automated weather observation 1 9 or 4 8 zulu wind 360 at 2 4 heat gusts 37 visibility 1 0 You Did a really good impersonation of that voice? I want to compliment you Yeah, so so what they said right there is they said that the pressure is 3010 so what that means is 30.1 inches of mercury and inches of mercury is the unit we use to measure barometric pressure 3010 what that means is 30.10 inches of mercury that that's the atmospheric pressure at the runway That's a little high that you know one standard atmospheric sea level is 29.92 inches of mercury And what that means is if you were to have a tube that had a vacuum in it And you were to have it in a upside down in a bowl of mercury The atmospheric pressure putting pushing down on the mercury in the bowl Is enough pressure to support a column of mercury 30.1 inches high doesn't matter how Thick the tube is or will it be the same if you have sufficient mercury with any thickness of tube Fascinating it should be the same it should be the same I mean there there is going to be some you know wedding effects, but nobody actually measures it with a tube of mercury I'm I'm sure there are some they did once. Yeah, we did once Now it's done with something called a bordon tube gauge, which is a whole other conversation But long story short, it's interesting and you're right pressure does change and so that's that's a neat thing It's just a neat thing to experience Uh, well, I can tell you where I am. I'm learning things. All right, so you get on a plane Where did you connect where'd you fly through to get there? Doha. Oh really have you ever been there before? No, that's a we have like a yeah a five-hour layover at midnight in dohah cool We went there and then we went from there to Tanzania And in Tanzania or Tanzania as a lot of people that live there say really Yeah, we we were met at the airport by a lady from killy warriors expeditions. Okay, and she took us to a hotel and we Had hoped it's pretty high altitude. There's a kilimanjaro airport right there pretty close to the base and we had hoped to acclimate a little bit before we started the hike But we didn't get there in time. We had to get there. We got to sleep one time And in fact when we got to the hotel the head of killy warrior expeditions had a meeting with us and also Said okay. Here's how this is going to work. You have to carry your day pack So you're going to carry your water. You're going to carry some food that you need and like some light, you know Body warmth type stuff and then we're going to carry your duffle bag And what the duffle bag is is that's the rest of your clothes for the rest of the expedition So what about like intensive stuff? Who's getting that? The porters handle that and so when you say porter You mean it in the most literal sense. They are carrying the stuff not just guiding you on the trail Oh, yeah, dang Not a joke, dude I didn't know this until we hit the ground there If you were to take 15 people on a nine day expedition into the wilderness 15 people And these people are not i'm talking about myself Not incredibly savvy in terms of where you are or what you're doing You want to take all the creature comforts to make everybody be able to survive in Legit wilderness How many people would you want on your team to handle 15 people 15? You would want 15 extra people. Yeah, I'd want one perk because each person you bring also has to handle themselves Okay, and I have been in the backcountry with people who failed something broke. They couldn't do it I've been in the backcountry with a guy who totally lost it Okay, and I was able to get out all of his stuff and all of my stuff But I couldn't have done more so for me right If you got 15 people and you need somebody to help cover that I think you need 15 more Okay, I thought you were 100 right That's kind of what I was thinking. I was so very wrong Okay, which way i've been i've been wrong on things a lot in my life This particular question is the wrongest I have been in recent memory on anything Okay to get 15 people to the top of Kilimanjaro They had a team of 90 people what and And so we're in this meeting at this hotel you took 105 people to the top of Kilimanjaro No, we did not all go to the top Kilimanjaro There was this huge logistics effort and it was like planning an assault on a small village So I didn't understand this until we got there. I'm like, what are we what are we doing? He's like oh, yes and the guy who was talking to us. I mean he was over the thing His name was wilbert. He says yes, we will be a village He said we will be a small village and I said, I'm sorry. I could have swore you said 90 people He said that's what I said And I said what will they be doing? He said you will see I was like, okay I mean this is and I talked to Tara and we're sitting there. We're like what's happening It was a nine day trip Seven up the mountain two down. Okay, my ratio Smacks of truth to me. Okay, hold this thought for a second I just want to stay with you visually you flew into dara saw him Mm-hmm. Nope. We flew into Kilimanjaro airport in tundria. Oh, okay. You said there was one I didn't realize you flew into that one. So it's a pretty quick trip then You didn't have a lot of overground travel and vehicles three hours. Yeah, it's still pretty good We stayed in a city called arusha and arusha was about three hours from Basically the entrance gate into Kilimanjaro park. So right on the border between kenya and tansania Yes, sir. Okay. And yep close to lake tansania. Is that right there as well? I don't think so. Okay, I don't I didn't see any water Okay. Yeah, I can't picture it. I mean I I know kilimanjaro is right between those two countries But I don't know where like tansanias. All right. Did you see wildlife on your drive? Very little very little we saw some Analope type things we saw some turkeys that didn't see that coming. It's also Okay A lot of birds, but no, I was I was like, are we gonna see an elephant or we go say no none of that didn't see any of that Okay, so Toto were all liars Well, I mean as a westerner. I mean you're going into this experience. You're like, I'm in africa What do you think zebras elephants giraffes may be lions? I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna see. Yeah, sure I didn't see any of that so the bio biomes is that what you said? As a you know, this sounded like a term that could be right The biomes that you you go through when you're hiking up this thing use first start in the rainforest And then you go through what's called the heather zone, which is like kind of scrubby brush kind of stuff And then you go through something called the morland which is I don't know high altitude like Not a lot be a tree kind of things. It's all sound like very british designations They do Heather and morland those are Things you can find on the british Isles Okay after that you went through the alpine desert and then and then you're kind of at the top Haha, please and stuff up there. Did you see snakes or spiders in the rainforest part? Ditzy spiders did not see snakes first night no joke dude two Incredibly significant events happened within 10 minutes of each other one of which is for public consumption On the internet here on the podcast one of which is not So I will read from my journal entry for you and then we will just be part of this out or whatever. Okay Actually, we're just going to gap the podcast. There's going to be a gap here So I'm going to read the following my entry goes like this Okay You Can't speak to that. Sorry. I'm I'm vetoing that going on the podcast An event happened an event happened that caused an earthquake. Well, the earthquake did happen So oh the earthquake was literal it was literally an earthquake So we were all in our tents for the first night. We went to the top of this mountain And the first day they're just kind of warming you up What I didn't understand is that our guide his name is shed rack shed rack Like yes, three guys who ended up in the fiery furnace in the bible not shed rack shed rack Shed rack shed rack. Yeah, I think I seen it that way. Okay. Okay. It's an incredibly intelligent individual not an exaggeration one of the most intelligent people I've ever met he's from Tanzania he's approaching 40 years old and What I didn't realize when I first met him is that he was constantly running emotional and social equations the entire time He was looking at every client on the crew He was looking at every porter on the team and he was summing up in his head if they were capable of moving forward Yes, they took pulse oximetry data Every night and every morning to make sure that your body was getting enough oxygen But at the same time he was like that individual is not talking as much today This individual over here. I'm going to go tell jokes with them And I didn't understand it until about day six But I was watching him and I was like oh my goodness. He is sandbagging so hard He's just having fun and being nice to everybody But he's actually assessing everybody's physical well-being their mental toughness Their ability to follow orders. He was an incredible Display of leadership that has been very rare for me to see Leadership of that quality in my life. It was amazing. It was incredible Fascinating so I mean the ideal way to evaluate in education. I think in any setting the ideal gold standard of evaluation is have someone who is the most attentive the most intuitive the most battle tested and knowledgeable Interact with people and give their expert evaluation I think it's more reliable than a test than a survey Too many variables there. Obviously you can't duplicate that on a grand scale So that isn't how we do evaluation in education very much anymore only very special programs can do it but instead of having you guys each go through some simple medical exam or look at these things or Take this shape and put it into a box of the same shape Instead Everything was contingent on shed rex Evaluation his intuition his experience everything was running through that and you didn't even know you were being tested Did he tell you it was more than that? No, he didn't tell us at first. He had assistant guides He was the head guide, but he had assistant guides. He had effeta. He had filimina He had loma. He had canini and they were all just around They were all around they were over here. They're gonna walk together But they're they're laughing and they're joking And at the same time they were evaluating us too and I and I later I talked to him and he's like yeah, we I said cheddar it took me days as I'm embarrassed to say it's taking me days to figure out what you're doing here But you're talking about us in swahili without us knowing And you are assessing what we're doing And you're measuring us emotionally He's like we he just kind of grand he's like maybe And I said you have names for us in swahili that we don't know don't you and he said it's possible What was your name? What did it mean? Oh, they named it the porters named me What did they name you? You know me and you know that I love people like I really really love people Yes, you do So you've got the clients and we had a fancy pants tent and we would go eat our meals in this fancy pants tent But there's also a porter tent right? And that's where the porters eat and there's 90 porters where there's about 70 something with the assistant guides But they picked up pretty quickly that I had a camera in my hand a lot So one guy randomly called me paparazzi And so they called me paparazzi. They're like a paparazzi. You know that was my name. That's great Yeah, that's great. And so they they mess with me. It was interesting To walk up a mountain not knowing so we started at 8,000 feet altitude and we decided to walk all the way up Before I slept at 8,000 first night Yes, sir. Well, we slept it higher than that. I want to say I want to say nine or ten the first night 8,000 is legit. So as a point of context for you That would be Like the top of sinks canyon in land or Wyoming Remember I took you up those big switchbacks. Yeah, and then you kind of get up to a new Level a new plateau up there and then lakes and it kind of flattens out for a while that's that's about 8,000 right there As somebody familiar with colorado is driving up toward say estus park or the ski areas That's more than halfway up and you're getting into really beautiful clear water high mountain stuff Or here's another point of context. I think this is right the highest point in the black hills and in south dakota is a little under 8,000 And you don't see that Altitude again in north america going east wow. So I mean 8,000 sounds paltry given the numbers We've been just bandying about but 8,000 is a lot is my point It felt like a lot so I took notes here and I'll tell you why I took notes So One of my favorite videos on the internet of all time Charley is on a youtube channel called periodic videos made by brady heron Oh, I know him Yeah, good friend Brady made a video one of brady's favorite things in life is is hiking up to ever a space camp in Nepal I don't know for my money one of the the most heartwarming videos i've ever seen on the internet is a video that he made called boiling water at altitude or boiling boiling water on the way to everish or something like that and brady took a tea kettle And at their mommeter and he started his journey from a city in Nepal just walking straight up Uh over the course of several days and they they boiled water at different altitudes Turns out ever space camp and kill manjaro They're comparable to the same height like when you when brady got to his destination and kill manjaro was You know the top it's about the same altitude wow And so I called brady before the hike and I said hey brady, you know one of my favorite videos you've ever done is this one and I would love with your permission to redo this experiment And I would love to throw people toward your your video But I I kind of just want to redo it and uh just in a different location because I think it'd be fun Do you have any suggestions or first of all I asked for permission? And he said of course man brady was brady. He was like man. I don't own boiling water at altitude I was like yeah, but I mean you you hone this video concept and it be rude of me to do it and just rip you off I asked for permission and brady was enthusiastic about it And he said he loves the video as well and he wants any amount of traffic he can get to go to that video So I was excited about that then I asked him for advice. I was like well if you could do it again, what would you do? Professor polyacoff on the channel periodic videos brady made a follow-up video on everything he did wrong and the reason you do that in science is so people will do things differently Yep So one of the biggest things was I think you should use a thermocouple instead of a mercury thermometer or maybe it was an alcohol thermometer Whatever brady used so I bought two handheld pocket cooking thermometers that were you know You used a thermocouple in them to display the temperature So I've got two of those and I I came home and I opened them and I tried to calibrate them And I noticed they were measuring different temperatures So I was like, you know what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take them and we're gonna boil water all the way up And then I'm just gonna take the measurements on this thermometer and this thermometer So I have a book right here. Can you see on the zoom call here? You see? Yep. Yep. I've got altitudes and And then I've got like the thermometer temperatures at each altitude Does it feel really good to have an old school field notes book written on in pencil Taking actual field notes and measurements. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, that's pretty legit man. That looks cool Yeah, it was really fun. This is that a little moleskin book. I got you only skin So it was really cool. And so we did that experiment I won't talk about the data right now, but but it was really really fun. That was our side quest Okay And so I asked shed rack the first meeting. I was like, hey man, they didn't know about smarter every day I was like, this is a thing I want to do Shed rack started joking with me early on he called me the troublemaker and he's like, you know, because we we just started We became quick brothers. You know, we could kind of after about the second night It was no longer my experiment. It was shed racks experiment and I was just along for the ride So I took lab mics that would record and I took these thermocouples And so the way it went down is we would walk into a camp Sometimes if we had enough altitude gain during the day we would walk in for lunch and they would set up a tent And they would cook lunch dude. They would cook it was good Soups, I mean fried foods all kinds of stuff fresh fruit all the time and they were hiking these things up They've hyped bread up All the porters did so anyway, we would roll into camp. Let's say we're rolling in at lunch here Here's a data point here. It looks like a 11,500 feet We rolled into camp And then shed rack could be like hey man, you want to boil water? I was like, yeah, let's do it And so I'd go over to shed rack. I had a little box and I can I kept my lab mic and I kept my thermocouples And I would hand them to shed rack What are you filming with? Just a little go pro like camera called the DJI action cam. Oh, yeah Another one cool. Yeah, it seemed to be the most reliable. I decided not to take the big camera good Um, I decided not to take my big film camera even though I wanted to so I just took little point and shoot film cameras But you brought the phantom right so you could make water boiling at altitude 165,000 frames per second now I didn't 75 hour video by the exact by the third day or so Shed rack would be like hey man, we're gonna boil after we eat or we're gonna Tell me when we were doing things. I was like sure and I would walk over hand him the little container that had the microphones He would open up the box He would pull out the two lab mics and he would say here this one's yours. I was like, oh, thank you And he was okay. This is my thermocouple. This one's yours And so like you see the emotional shift that happens and how important that is So it happened and so then I was just I was just this supplier of the scientific instrumentation. It's all I was Mm-hmm prior to the trip. I wanted to know our altitude. I learned that in Colorado So I bought a Garmin watch that could go for seven hours You know seven days without a charge. Yeah, and I can hit a button and I could calibrate our altitude based on GPS and I could do barrow Bare-o-presh you could oh got it. Okay. Yeah, my buddy who was with us on the trip his name is Paul He was in the British military once upon a time and so he had GPS gear. I had the watch thing And so we we had a good time. It was a blast. I would just take a data point at certain altitudes and certain boiling temperatures and It was fun, man. It was great. Okay Let's talk about itinerary a little bit. I want to fill in the whole picture here. You started at 8,000 feet You set up your little camp. I think it's really hard to picture camp when you're not there So for example on our adorable little hike, which is what we did I mean our thing I think we went 18 miles total to be clear. That's more than anybody I know in the US I don't know anybody that's hiked at that altitude in the US. It was not a little hike. That's a serious thing. Yeah, well By comparison, it's I have never slept above a mile high and you have Fair enough. I yes, I have slept above a mile high once or twice. Yeah How many porters did you have on your trip? We did not have porters because we had 90 That's pretty impressive. Our packs were Mine was 31 and hers was 29 pounds mine was 20 About 20 pounds as well. Okay. Yeah, so we were dragging along a little more. We over packed we learned things Everybody's but on our on our cute little hike where we didn't even make it to the top of where we were going Setting up camp was really fun. It was fun to pick a spot And we had ambitions of getting up this drainage a couple more lakes Before we shut it down for the night. You're just in a cathedral. There are huge mountains on both sides Beautiful rock formation snow still even in mid summer post 4th of july mid summer And it was lovely. It was getting toward dusk I'm not as concerned with setting up a camp in the dark. We can do it. We have lights, but you know, okay We want to get situated. You want to know your environment? Ideally you want to set up while it's light You know, we got up a little ways and same bull moose that we ran into the next day was block on the road Just right on the path Uh taking his time It's like well, do we wait for a moose to go away and maybe lose our light or do we just go back and set up here in the last Obvious spot. So we turned around went back And there were a couple dudes there from I remember Gillette, Wyoming or something and they could tell we were kind of trying to find Somewhere, it's very remote. I mean, there's not a lot of people up there, but there aren't a lot of obvious spots They're called the rocky mountains. They're very rocky And these guys were kind enough to be like you can be sort of close to us. There's room just pull up here and so We set up camp next to a Seasonal pond That was now emptied out next to a big beautiful glacial drainage lake We were just above where the seasonal pond crater is it's all green and grassy now because there've been water in it all spring And we get you a course we're trying to find a flat spot and so we probably landed in an area that was maybe 50 feet long by 20 feet wide Surrounded on three sides by real tall pine trees not super dense Not super thick branches. It was hard to rig up our bear contraption to keep our food off the ground But also far enough away from a tree that a bear couldn't just climb the tree and grab it I mean, it's trickier than you'd figure And we probably had to walk down about 30 or 40 feet and drop about 12 feet in elevation to get down to our water supply or to fish Down at the lake filter. Yeah For this trip we took water bottles. I don't remember the brand. It was pretty cool. It was like a standard issue Water bottle like you'd take to the gym But you can unlock the body of the water bottle It's like a casing that goes over the top of it's like a like a now jean It's like a russian doll water bottle. Okay, right? A barely smaller water bottle inside of a water bottle So you disconnect the thing you fill the casing with water straight out of the lake Then you take your other one and you force it down in and that pushes the water up through the bottom of The actual chamber you're going to drink out of and the force you exert To press the inner bottle into the outer bottle full of water that forces it through It filters everything out and the water just tasted great kind of a lot of work to drink 12 ounces of water But you know it's better than jjardia. So so we did that so that's kind of the vibe of camp At that altitude in that wilderness area. No fires. I just hate that Yeah, I mean that's how you round out a night and it is feel the achievement You burn a thing the burning is a metaphor for things you need to do it It's part of the ordeal So I hated not having that but that was our vibe I camp and everybody wore mosquito nets because it was thick. So we all looked like beekeepers We made forts out of mosquito nets. What was the vibe at your camp? What did it look like? In the morning, uh, we would get up we would eat breakfast that they prepared for us and they they had several rules They said these are my rules the shed rack on and the crew said I need you to eat I need you to drink a lot of water I need you to keep warm and I need you to have a positive attitude And and those were those were the rules and they meant them So they made you eat more than you wanted like I didn't want to eat as much as they were feeding us Like we were like, oh my gosh, man. I'm gonna be sick I'm eating then a couple times when I eat a lot of food The blood flow goes to my stomach and I can feel my heart beating faster like when I'm doing physical activity Okay, and a couple times we would start the hike and my part rate would shoot up to 120 Just boom and I wasn't even doing much. It was just like I was digesting and hiking at the same time Oh, you know north of 8,000 feet though. I mean, that's true heart rate goes up quick for that too So we would eat breakfast Well, we'd wake up in our tents and there were two people in each tent Tara and I shared a tent My daughter shared a tent with another young lady, you know at 630. We'd wake up in the morning And a lady this blew my mind the first time it happened. There's this beautiful kind lady named uh, alina And she would wake you up along with another guy named, uh, joshua They would wake you up by knocking on your tent at 630 kind of shaking your tent and they'd say good morning Caribou which is you know caribou's a way of saying you're welcome good morning Um, would you like some coffee and they unzipped your tent and they shoved a cup of hot coffee? Dang now it was like paint thinner, but it was I'd like to try coffees someday. Yeah, shut up But I know you have but they they uh would hand you that coffee And that would just wake you and then you had an hour to get your stuff packed and to get to the breakfast tent Yeah, that was harder than you would think no no no it is not harder than I would think really It's exactly as hard as I would think it was an hour to break camp every day. That's tiring That's quick an hour to pack your individual stuff not to break So the minute you get out at so at 730 you get out of that you weren't breaking down your tent The porters did that the porters did that and they were come on you're being soft an hour to get your crap I mean it takes longer than you'd figure because stuff gets wet and it gets dirty and you got to fleck off all of the little Tagalongs and junk to try to keep some sense of cleanliness and order, but yeah, I don't know if you didn't have to I mean every on the tent Every day I would get up, you know and you know day one you're like, okay Well, obviously I packed everything out of order Because these are the items I actually need for today And today they're saying we should prepare for sun and you always have to be ready for rain because we're on a mountain And so you had to get all your stuff out and then you know you get the the gold bond powder and you powder the boys And you know you get everything I've got five sets of underwear and I got to figure out what i'm gonna wear what day You know It's really 20 sets of underwear because each one of those has a front back inside and out Exactly exactly So it was a thing so once you go to the the mess tent You would eat And then they'd say okay, we're ready. This is what we're gonna do today We're going from this elevation to this elevation and this way And we get ready to go and you go getting and I was the only person in our crew that used the poles every day I use tell me about the poles. What did you think of those? Um Okay, first explain those for the third chair. What are the poles? They're just hiking sticks It like if you're skiing you see skiers use these poles so a lot of people use them for hiking a lot of people Like I was one of the few I was the only person that used them the whole time Are you kidding me? No, I'm the only person that used in the whole time Why people just didn't need them they had good balance and I was like, you know The last thing I want to happen is to injure myself So I was extremely conservative in the weeks leading up to the trip. I didn't do anything dude I did the stair stepper machine at the gym with a restricted oxygen Stepper and I did nothing else because I was like if I just tweak a knee I mean, that's a huge deal. Yeah, and so when we were hiking I would see you know how when you hike your brain is doing a thousand calculations. Yes all said You're like, okay, am I gonna walk on this rock or that rock and you have to choose 100% of the time maybe once or twice I took a thing but almost 100% of the time I took the most conservative path I was like, you know, I'm gonna take these four steps Instead of those two that are higher and I would do that because I was playing the long game So what do you use the poles for? I I still think somebody who's never done this who's sitting with us talking here They don't understand the polls. How do we get that better? It takes three points to define a plane and so a stool can sit on a surface with three points Okay, so if I'm taking a step, I'm gonna take that pole and I'm gonna stick it out in front of me And I'm gonna say okay, that's a rock right there that's solid I'm gonna put this pole on that rock and so I put the pole on the rock and then take a step with my right foot And like okay, cool and that foot's in their correct position. I'm gonna take my other pole and I'm gonna put it over there I'm gonna take a step so I always tried to maintain at least two Often three points of contact with the ground. Yeah, and these poles don't think they're telescopic Really lightweight things ski poles. Yes, sir. You have a Pointer on the end of it. Yes. There was a little pointy metal piece I did not have a basket on the end of my poles which really like snow. Yeah did not let's see I like those for snow and mud Or I just keep you from going in Too far. Yeah, I was one of the only people that used them everybody else just kept them clipped to their backpack I'm like man. I got him. I'm using them in defensive poles. I think they are incredible Yeah in those environments because You can help lighten the load You can make your shoulders your biceps your forearms your wrists whatever has energy You can transfer the effort of climbing that mountain To that part of your body using the poles and tell something else recovers And I just adore that and I've got different modes When I'm kind of wanting to take ground I put my hands on the pomels on the top like an old man would do like an old man cane Yep And I put them behind me and I'm pushing forward the poles are Always a foot behind me. I stretch them out to their greatest length And it's like I'm rowing forward Love the way that feels one of the assistant guys saji he taught me he's like hey when you're going uphill You want your poles short when you're going downhill. You want your poles along And I was like oh yeah, that's how an angle works. Yeah, that makes perfect sense That's what I did. We'd get all your stuff on Yeah, you eat breakfast and then we'd go and the minute we start hiking The porters would break down all of camp fast extremely fast and they lined up They literally got in a line and they all had a huge duffel bag in front of them And the lead guide would go down the line And he would say okay. I need everyone to carry the porters He had every porter carrying a certain amount of weight I forget what it was it might have been 10 15 k. I don't know It's about 30 or 40 pounds. They would all carry a very significant amount of weight But they distributed it evenly I developed a relationship with a lot of the porters And so I would go up there's one guy his name was saidie saidie He didn't speak much english and I would just go up and give him a fist bump. He'd go paparazzi I was like saidi you know we'd talk And I would say what are you carrying today? And he would show me I would always say thank you Asante saana, you know always say thank you so much for doing this and We all agreed all of the clients. We agreed that it was humbling and we felt bad the entire time like Yes, we paid for this guide service and we paid for porters to help us But in our community, you know a lot of these people you know them well And you know the type of people these are they don't want to be served They just don't want to be in a situation where someone is serving you like to bring me a cup of hot coffee in the morning While i'm in my tent that means you got up early and that means you went and got water and you heated it up I don't know it was just a very very difficult thing to be served like that And so it was humbling is a weird calendar thing because they were simultaneously exalting you But you were humbled by the experience and it just I don't know you would have I think felt the same way Yes, we did that sort of stuff. They broke down camp. They divided up all the gear They made sure everybody had an appropriate amount of gear I learned that it's better to carry a short Small compact 15 kilograms Then a big wide basket of bread for example that's 15 kilograms like you want a very dense pack And um, the porters were very skilled and how they carried things and they were extremely fast They loved you like genuine Love at the end of the trip. We got to say something and we're like hey, we figured out your secret your secret is Yes, this is a job, but you do actually love us And your little community here a fellow porters You love each other. There's a brotherhood and a sisterhood amongst you I loved the culture. I really did it was fun. So we'd get up break camp and then we'd start walking It was camp huge was a little city with streets and alleys and stuff There were two bathrooms, meaning they had a tent that was like a just a single person Vertical tent and there was a small toilet about half the size of a five gallon bucket It was a western looking plastic toilet Okay, and night one he taught us how to use it He's like here's how it works You you do your business here You push this little button here and it pumps water into it and you pull this little thing and it'll open up a hole And your waist will go down to the bottom and you close it They hiked waist off them out dude They didn't do incinerator toilets. They carried out the waist. It's incredible. Yeah, absolutely Have you ever used an incinerator toilet? No Same concept instead of falling down into the bottom of the bucket a compartment that keeps the smells and everything muted by sealing up and having a fluid in it It falls down into a burn chamber Wow, then it just cooks everything into a little dust that is Tiny and meaningless and goes away. Wow. That's so yeah I'm kind of surprised they didn't use incinerator toilets But maybe the problem there is that it takes a long time to incinerate or fuel and it's getting a lot of use I mean that's still as heavy a lot of people using those toilets Yeah, it's wild the stuff you don't think about right? Well, the thing that made it really difficult is they recommended that we all take a drug called diamox and diamox di amox di amox But there's okay was extremely intelligent and he knew the actual name of the drug He also knew all the latin names for all the flora and fauna, which was awesome but um He knew the actual name of the drug, but the the generic term is diamox It helps with oxygen exchange and alpha 2 sickness But the side effect is you have to pee all the time all the I have no idea. I had something to do with pulling the sulfur out of your body or some other chemical out of your body I don't know I would be lying if I said something did you take malaria meds as well I did the first few days and then once we got above 8 000 feet. They're like, yeah, there's no There's just no mosquitoes here. So did it make you taste metal in your mouth and dream crazy things No, that's mefloquine that does that We were taking malarone this time but mefloquine the the once a week drug in my past experience do you have not so psycho dreams yes, I finally quit I was like just bring on the malaria really I can't do oh, yeah, when I was teaching in zambia. I'd be there for a long time teaching those college classes I was way out in the bush. Why did you teach in africa? I taught history of thought World civilizations and history of philosophy and thought The college there there's a big land grant to this college that I worked at But it was way way way out there. There was no Meaningful road. I mean the worst road I've ever driven on all the way in all the way out is a remarkable thing You just couldn't imagine driving out there that there would be a college But then you get out there and here's this thriving community and was really quite the thing But it was remote all the animals out there all the wild stuff and lots of mosquitoes lots of malaria I I ran the value equation after several nights of those dreams one time. I was like, uh I bet malaria is horrible, but I can't function. I can't work. I'm not sleeping It was a whole category of dream. I'd never had before you know, you got your categories like Scary thing is happening and you can't respond. Yeah, that's one of the categories can't run can't talk can't scream out for help There's that one. There's socially embarrassing category Naked at school or whatever. I think it really is a school on naked day. Yeah, there's um Not nice not appropriate dream where you just wake up and you're like, okay, let's just pretend that I didn't dream that What are you gonna do? Yeah, um, you know, you got all these categories. I had categories of dreams Well, another category dream that I have is completely cohesive narrative that I wake up and write down and the story works Yeah, I know right. Those are awesome. Just love them Uh, I think I've told you before about the one dream I had where I lived a whole life I met a girl on a riverboat We were both in fifth grade and we fell in love and we got married when we turned 20 And we had kids and I knew their names and I knew her parents and we had weddings and funerals and I went to college And I learned things and I got older and eventually people I loved died And I was old and then I woke up and like that was my wife And I had kids and I had grandkids all this was I was in fifth grade We moved a bunch of things around and my sister got bumped down to the couch while we were doing a project downstairs And I had her yellow bedroom that one night that I slept in there And I had this whole dream where I lived a whole life and learned things in the dream And when I woke up, it was like I could feel all of my education and all of my memories from this whole life Emptying out in this one dream and I started to grieve and panic as I realized i'm a fifth grader I remember this like it was yesterday. This is one of the most impactful things that ever happened in my life And I realized like oh crap like I haven't gone through puberty. I'm a fifth grader. I I don't have a wife I don't have kids. Huh, what were their names? And I'm trying to like remember their names and remember stories and I went into my parents and I woke them up. I'm like ah a thing I'm like I'm dying I like my whole life is disappearing It's the hardest thing to possibly explain but I had that dream. That's like inception the movie that yes And I don't think that was as psycho as what I had when I was on that malaria medicine So you woke your parents up and told them that I woke them up and tried to explain to them as the memories Or just inception style collapsing out of my brain It was cool world. The last time I remember waking my mother up when I was a child Yeah, I remember blessed her heart mom worked third shift to make things work for us And I walked in there one day and it was like the weird twilight like it's about Sons about to go down. She's trying to squeeze her last bit of sleep in before work And I'm like hey mom. She's like what I was like I just wrote the best s I have ever written She's like what I was like look at it. It's a beautiful Looking back Here you are you're like the contrast generation of my Very different. I lived two lives completely all the way to the end and now i'm reverted It's 20 75 in my timeline and now i'm in fifth grade again. Well look at the s-man It's so good. Look at all the curves Anyway, some malaria meds. Yeah, yeah, they do apparently it never wore off Oh nice too Some of the ladies started to admit some of the dreams they were having Or morning too, they started saying hey, I had a really really bad dream and like yeah What is it and then they would say and I was like do not repeat that to anyone And one of the common things was I had a dream that we were at the top of the mountain And then somebody said was I there like people were like You had a dream. We made it. It was I at the top of the mountain because we we didn't know right? We don't know we're gonna make it or not. Yeah, so yeah What a fun thing to have that conundrum That plot device driving the unfolding of the whole story Whereas for us with our adorable little hike, we had no pressure like that. I knew from the get-go I'm gonna go as far as it feels like makes sense to make this a win for my kid For you Come on. You're flying halfway around the world It's one of the few mountains that I mean it's got to be One of the best known mountains on earth if you asked one of the seven on the planet Yeah to name three mountains Uh, that one's gonna come up in just about everybody's list is a huge deal Can you or can't you will you or won't you and so I don't think it's any surprise at all That's what everybody's medicated subconscious. These were trying to Swear through on the way up and what really started getting weird is like day four They said hey I regret to inform you that we we had to send three of the porters home They went back down the mountain and we're like, I'm sorry. What they're like. Yeah, we we had someone that became ill And we sent two porters with them Like what happened and so we're we're like you're the porters You're our life law. You somebody got sick and so we're freaking out. There's only 90 of you It's right When it started getting real was day six So day six the rule thumb now tear up my wife is a positions assistant. She went out to a Out of new mexico. She went to a mountain Like she has to do continuing medical medical education credits every year Sure And so this year she elected to do a mountaineering training course like she's a certified mountaineering medical Whatever you want to call it Awesome And so she did this a few months before we went so she learned that what you want to do is you want to hike high sleep low And you do that to acclimate your body This didn't make sense to me, but there's one day we hike to 15 1,500 feet that's where we were on asleep And they said okay everyone we have time we're gonna do an acclimation hype to 16,000 I was like what? They're like yeah, so we're at 15,000 250,500 in that area We're gonna leave our day packs here and we're gonna hike get a bottle of water and destiny and carry your little sissy poles or whatever And we're gonna hike up to 16,000 and we're gonna come back That's discouraging It is because I just end feet. I just gain I just and worked for this and almost that is very hard for people in the third chair to appreciate a thousand feet 11 12 Base paths a two very long disc golf holes But up Yeah, you give a part of yourself up to gain a thousand feet at that elevation And then you turn around and you handed it right back to the mountain That's tough But what I didn't understand and this is what shed rack and soggy and lomo were telling me they said yeah, here's the deal It doesn't make sense But we're gonna hike up that mountain and that's gonna tell your body how much oxygen is up there And it's gonna tell your body something And then we're gonna come right back down. So I don't know the mechanism inside the body The way the differential equations of the body works when you're doing respiration You're like I got this much oxygen and it's something that starts making red blood cells in your body And it says hey, this is how many red blood cells I need They said we're gonna hike up and then we're gonna hike back down And then when we do that That will help us for tomorrow and that's what we did we did that But that's the day it got hard because the following day we took what was called the northern circuit So we hiked around imagine a crater And imagine that you're approaching from the west side of the crater And then you're gonna go up around the top of the crater And then you get over to the three o'clock position on the crater And then you cut into the lip of the crater and you go up to the peak That's how we hide it great description. I can picture that exactly When we got to 16,000ish feet, that's when it was game on So in the only wildlife we saw While we were there was a dead buffalo Like a dead cape buffalo up at a certain altitude it was interesting, but anyway the day of the summit We wake up and they said hey, here's the deal Everybody's gonna wake up at midnight and they're gonna go to the summit and they're gonna be at the summit for sunrise We're not gonna do that We're gonna wake up at 3 a.m And we're gonna make it Almost to the top And then we're gonna see sunrise on this side of the mountain and then we're gonna push over And then we're gonna see it and so that's what we did so at 3 a.m We all got together And a couple times before the porters left on a couple of days they would sing and dance Jurru Mimi Goko I Didn't pumped up for the day And it was very clear like They are trying to pump us up give us positive attitudes. They're trying to do it They're imparting that to us Had you yet felt despair? Yeah at times people did no joke. Did you feel despair? No, did not No, just stubbornness, you know, just like I'm gonna just go There were times when I was you know, you're kind of wondering you're like man There's 15 of us in the line Everybody seems to be doing really good And I had my my heart rate here on my watch and there's one other guy that was with us His name is Lawson. He also had his heart rate on his watch. I was like, hey Lawson What are you at? He's like I'm in 120 beats per minute right now. It was like me too, man You know, we were like we're doing okay. We're about normal There was one time at about 14 and a half thousand We got done with lunch I wanted to take a selfie with a dead buffalo and I ran To the buffalo to take a picture And I ran back and I got the camp and I looked at my watch and my heart's going 130 140 And I looked at them and I was like guys I just made a mistake Like what do you mean? I said don't run just do not run at this altitude Because my heart it took well over an hour for my heart to get back down. What altitude was this? Is it 16? This was 14ish Yeah, it was I remember the camp but it was not smart dude It was one of the only times I took a risk and I did it because I felt like I was holding people up Sure. Yeah, I can see some knowledge. If I had it to do over again, I would not have done that It was so very stupid show me the selfie. I'll do it. Let me get it right here And then you can tell me if it was worth it. That's exactly what I was gonna do There it is Wow, that is a very dead cape buffalo If you look in the background of that image, you see the clouds You see the clouds. I do you're looking down on them. Yep. I'm oriented. Yeah. Yeah It was nuts. And so it took me a long time to recover from that Speaking of taking photos of dead rotting buffalo carcasses This episode of notom questions is brought to you by company cam Which is about organizing photos that you take But not of dead rotting buffalo carcasses. I just said that for the segue. Look is your friend man You can't look man. Well, he is my friend. That's why I know he's gonna like it. Look when you do an ad Okay, so here's how this worked. I don't know if you realize this company cam has decided to sponsor this episode of notom questions Right means they give us money. They give us money. Yes And we have to talk about their product in a true way but also Usually it's favorable And I don't think luke wants company cam associated with the types of photos you just explained Plus that doesn't even explain the purpose of their company and like why people might want to use company cam I know you I know you're like We're a hundred something episodes in but I really would have figured this out by now Well, here's the thing though If you were doing a project that involved a dead rotting buffalo carcass on the side of a giant mountain in Tanzania And you could use company cam to organize that photo it would technically work So you know what I feel like what I did is right you're joking But this actually makes sense can do okay. So the guides on the trip They took photos along the way and they updated our families on the internet They they were like hey They called us the bigger the big group is doing great No joke. There was one of the guides his name was fata fata would Early on when they called me paparazzi as I told you basically said hey, you know how to take photos How do I take photos? And so fata brought me aside He's like hey, man. I looked at some of the photos you took yesterday of our group They're great Tell me how to take better photos And then fata would run up ahead of us and he would wait for we were all in the line And then he would take a photo And then that photo would go on whatever social post he was doing But the point is Our group the 15 of us we were their job Uh-huh And no joke your buffalo rotting carcass joke Actually would work with company cam because the purpose of company cam Is if you have a job that takes place over a long period of time A photo is worth a thousand words so you document the progress of the job with a camera Usually on your phone And then you upload it so that you can show and verify that yay verily the work has been done That's what company cam does for contractors So in this case the company we went with our guides They could have used company cam to document the process of getting us up the mountain Yeah, I guess I could have said you have anything that you feel like you need to say to me now Uh No, no, I don't know anything morally ethically any outstanding burden as a friend Anything I apologize man. I'm sorry. You can do make a ton of sense. That could happen. So apology accepted I didn't have to do that Your buddy like in all seriousness your buddy luke is awesome And he has decided to sponsor note of questions with his very successful company called company cam And if anybody out there is a contractor or you're doing anything that involves You know like if you're building a bridge if you're doing whatever and you want to document the process of getting the thing done Company cam is a great option to do that.

We also have killy on three And we did what they called pulley pulley and swahili pulley pulley means slowly slowly And so they said you're gonna walk Very very slowly and she'd rock took the lead and he walked incredibly slowly And the goal is to keep your heart rate in that you're regulated by your cardiovascular system And your pulmonary system You get it to a steady state heartbeats per minute and you don't move you just keep it at that rate That might mean slowing down the higher you go, but you keep your heart rate at a sustainable pace And that's what we did and about 400 feet in elevation into the hike. We're hiking by headlamp We are wearing an incredible amount of year because it's very very cold at the top We had to carry these big you know where our porters helped us But we had been packing these huge ski clothes the entire time just for this day Because we know we're gonna go from 15,500 Up to 19,300 you doing that in a day Yeah, and then all the way back down to 15 something to barafu count They didn't tell us about the day man That was a 12-hour day When we started hiking we're up about 400 feet and gain an elevation off our camp. We started realizing holy cow It's happening. This is the day Can I do it? Am I actually capable of this? They say people start dropping at 17,000 feet What if we get there and I drop? What are we gonna do? Internally you start having that monologue dude At that moment the porters started singing Oh One of the most peaceful Aunting in a good way songs i've ever heard but when they started singing Like this piece came over us. It's like wow they knew exactly what they were doing We just slowly started hiking and canini one of the assistant porters who was an older man But canini could read people and he knew it was time to sing and he would sing and all the porters sang And there's nothing you can do you don't know the language mat You don't know how to sing the song you don't know the words of the song every once in a while you can pick out polly polly Which means slowly slowly but you can tell that it's a song of i don't know like overcoming it like a song of ascent ascent a s c e n t there's psalms of ascent You sing them when you are going up to the temple to worship god as you proceed up to this place is elevated place where the worship of god happens in the old testament and in niyamaa toward the end of niyamaa There's a whole scene where niyamaa puts together the dedication of the walls of ancient jirousalam that he oversaw the rebuilding of And they're all singing these Songs of ascent two choirs snaking together along the walls and intersecting And all of the crowds the kids the women the old people they're all going up together to celebrate this thing this generational Achievement that they all just accomplished in the book of psalms in the bible Such songs that you would sing on such an occasion like that I picture that being very solemn very reflective very um encouraging And those are psalms of ascent. There is not an equivalent thing in our culture in america to what I experienced in that moment Fair enough. It was incredible We all felt it and we all wanted to say something and we all kept our mouths 100 shut and we just listened I mean, I think I said that's beautiful. I think that's all I said, but we were just like it was just amazing And so We hiked in darkness for two and a half three hours All we were looking at was the people's feet behind us and then the sun started coming up behind us over the mountain behind us Which is another peak there? I want to say it's called mount maru I may be wrong about that one of the other peaks of kiln and jaro it started coming up behind us And as it came up You could see the sun coming up over the clouds. Yeah, I mean this is incredible Then at about 17,500 feet something else happened We looked up And there was a man a western man Being rushed down the mountain. He had a guide on his left and a guide on his right. He had an oxygen mask on his face And you could see oxygen pouring out of the mask and he's not okay He's being rushed down the mountain with a person He's making contact with the ground like every third step. He's being drug Like a zombie down the mountain by these people on his left and his right and we look up at that as the sun's rising to our back and we're like He's not okay. This this guy has altitude whatever. This is not altitude. Yeah, no, that's a demon This is a rescue situation and they are running him straight down the mountain Which at this point is like sand. It's like Straight up loose gravel sand and we are just having so if you were to step it on an eight inch rock I said Here comes a rock and I have a video I was like here comes a rock And I can't explain but that rock is going to take all my oxygen And the moment I said that Lawson stepped up on the rock He got one foot up and then the other foot up and he just stood there and he breathed and he breathed and he breathed and he's like okay And then he started walking And then I had to do the exact same thing And so that's the environment that you're in and when that guy starts rushing down the mountain in that moment at this point We had about 12 12 guides and porters with us One of which volunteered to carry a gas bottle so that we could boil water at the top At the moment when we saw this guy we start freaking out every one of us start freaking out And we didn't tell anybody we were freaking out It was all on our heads and canini starts singing again and he starts singing The point of the song was clear Shut up Quit worrying about it. You follow shed rack who's at the front of the line and you keep going and you don't look at that man And you don't worry about it, but it was a deal man Do you have your iPhone with you? Yes I just sent a four second video clip to your phone Just understand that this video is a lot brighter than it actually was imagine its twilight This is the only clip we caught at the guy coming down the mountain somebody on the team caught it But look at how he's walking. Can you see it? Oh my goodness Okay, first of all I can hear the wind That That guy's not there He's beat up He's not there dude It was a thing dude. He would die If not for the people on either side of him. Yeah, he was like me in the video. The I don't want to die Video did he die? No, this guy did not die, but he was like me when I was in the hypoxia video Like he clearly is not there Yeah, that freaks you out Am I just sent you another video of the mountain to our backs? We're hiking away from this peak where that the sun is rising over It was a thing man And so at that moment in time we had a couple of people in our crew that started having problems Is clear that a lot of the problems were in our heads, right? The guides did something amazing They stopped everybody and they got together with the people that were struggling and they said what's going on? Okay, so you're feeder heavy. Okay. Got it. Understand and then shed rack just Systematically defeated the mental game. He got another guide He said, okay, uh, saji come here saji your job is now to walk with this person You're gonna walk in this way and that I would have fallen back and taken the person that was struggling and put him in the back of the line That's not what he did He took the person that was struggling and he sent them ahead like a sprinter And he said get up the mountain and they did They just went and he grabbed the person's hand Their arm and he just went straight up the mountain They got a hundred yards in between us and them and they got to Gillum point first Which was the first peak and once they got the Gillum point The mental game was over we were at 18,500 feet like okay. It's only 800 more feet We can do this everything leveled out. Okay. So one of two things are happening right now. You are either setting up to tell me That it seemed like it was a done deal once you got to that point And then to give me the twist in the story, which is then something bad happened and we did not make it or It really was a done deal when you got there and you closed it out Billion dollar question. Did you make it? We did we made it so we got to Gillum point All 15 huh and shed rack and the crew said We had a meeting several days ago And we decided that your group was strong enough for everyone to make it And the reason we decided that is because everybody was staying positive And we decided you were physically strong enough that wasn't going to be the issue It was going to be the mental game and we decided that because you're encouraging each other along the way We had no disputes. We had no Bickering. I mean we we just all were working with each other It was 14 people from Alabama. We had another guy brian from ohio that went with us But we just all were rooting for each other one person had more altitude Type symptoms than others and we were all like Rooting for them gray in for them helping them any kid chance we got it was great It was a it was a great great group of people but shed rack revealed to me at the top I said hey man All 15 made it is that normal? He said this is not normal. He said it is not normal for a group of 15 for everyone to make it This is actually rare. He said usually you'll have at least two or three that can't But we all made it and it was a testament to My first of all glory to god for making it because I mean it's just like rant rolling the dice right whether your body can handle it But the fact that the leadership of shed rack and his team at killy or your expedition I don't know it was really fun. It was really fun to be in the position of weakness and to be given a challenge and To have an opportunity to rise up and try to tackle it just by obeying your leader and doing what your leader said Like there was one moment where my daughter wasn't putting on enough sunscreen And shed rack pulled me aside. I wouldn't say he disciplined me, but he told me what to do He's like I expect her to wear this much sunscreen at this time and this is how you're gonna apply it. I said yes, sir That's exactly what I'm gonna do. And so it's what we did He's like this is not where you're from. We were in a different environment. I'm gonna need you to do this and I said absolutely yes, sir And so it was uh, it was a blast dude. It was a huge thing. We made it at the top We spent about 15 minutes on the top. We boiled water on the top of kilimanjaro I won't tell you the temperature at boil that but it was shocking And then we started down the mountain and we had another four hours ish. Was it four hours? It was so long, dude It was the longest day of a physical activity I've ever done We went all the way down to barafu camp back down to 15-5 or so Don't tell me about the descent yet. Okay. Tell me about the 15 minutes Did you think epiphany thoughts or did it just come and go so quickly that it was left to you to reflect on what all of this meant Later, we got to stella point which is not quite to the top stella points like you're halfway around the crater And we get to stella point Paulina who knocks on our door in the morning with coffee was there with hot chocolate just waiting for him Yes And I said what She goes hello. I said Paulina. You're here. She goes. Oh, yes, of course And I was like well What's happening like how are you here? And she goes oh we came up before you And you said oh clearly Paulina I was like what do you mean you came up before us and they had boiled eggs for us to eat they had cookies Playful, you know like vacation bible school packaged cookies, but they were cookies and we had chocolate They're like, please eat. I was like, I don't want to eat. They're like, of course you don't want to eat That's the altitude. This is the point where your body starts to lie to you. You're gonna eat. Yes, ma'am. I will eat Asante Sano she goes karebu and just She's welcome And so just very firm Kind leadership And she wanted me to get to the top she wanted my wife to get to the top She wanted every one of us to get to the top The porters and the guides are doing it for money. It's their job, but they were doing it for more than that It was very clear to me At Stella Point we ate a little bit Or near Stella Point we ate a little bit It was actually just before Stella Point and then we we went by the Stella Point sign which is the halfway point And which is the tee off to go down the mountain. They said, okay, that's it A hooroo peak right over there. We could see it on the other side of the crater Like, man, we just kind of make it there And you start to get that little rush. You're like, it's gonna happen I think it's actually gonna happen at this point. We're at 19,000 feet and like uh, Philomena said It's like philemon but the feminine version Philomena She said this is the point, you know, your body's gonna start lying to you gotta push through it So we you know she said that about 18-5 So we we started pushing and walking Everyone was so quiet And so silent because we were focusing on that sign a couple of the ladies as we approached the sign they broke down in tears Because they didn't think we could actually do it when when our buddy said hey, this is what we're gonna do Months ago. They didn't think we would actually make it there And so we walked up to the sign And one thing that happened on the way up. We had all got into our little line I was behind Lawson And then you know who was away from his wife and Tara was in a different part of the line But naturally as we got to within about 200 feet elevation Somebody called out organized into families. So as we start to realign ourselves into our families I'm getting in line behind Tara. She she slows down so that I could catch up to her Another man passes me so he could be with his wife And we start to line up and I'm looking at Tara and I'm thinking and she's an absolute stud Whatever the female equivalent of stud is Because she just did it There's this determination thing that Tara has my daughter has it as well like when they say hey, this is what we're going to do It's just going to happen. She will stop at nothing until the goal is achieved I loved this experience Specifically to see that in her Like months before I even started thinking about a plan She was already working out the logistics. She was already figuring out We need to be at this peak for this amount of time in Colorado in order to see if you have out there too She was working all the logistics and I was just in cruise control And in a way her brain took me to the peak because she had done all the the preparation She had done all the thinking for our family our specific family and uh, it was really neat to just kind of get in behind her there and I think I held her hand, but I don't remember Because my brain wasn't working well I remember trying to film her approach and it was really cool And I remember dropping my phone and having to pick it up and that being very difficult But like there was this approach moment that was just really emotional on uh many levels But uh, I'm very very proud of my wife or what she did and how she did it It was really really fun to see her in that environment. I really enjoyed it We all gathered around the sign at uh, who rupeek And uh, there was one person that was off to the side and somebody said it was just the thing We just knew we were gonna do it. They said hey We're waiting on you. We're all gonna touch it together And so we waited until that individual walked over. I've got it on video and they walked over And we all waited and we said, okay, here we go Three two one and everybody put their hand on the sign at the same time Like there was nobody ahead or behind or anything. It was just all at the same time And it was just like a common understanding. These were very good people It was a weird moment because you're at 19 000 feet and you don't have enough oxygen to think I didn't read the sign. I saw the Tanzanian flag I saw the word a hooroo. I saw the word kill him in jar. I didn't read the rest of the sign It was too hard to read. I just couldn't I mean I probably could have but I was like, I'm not going to spend my energy reading that sign We'll have a picture. I'll read it later. What does the sign say? It says congratulations. You're at a hooroo peak the highest point in africa That's gilman's point. Let me just read directly off the thing Mount Kilimanjaro congratulations. You are now at the hooroo peak Tanzania 5,895 meters 19,341 feet amsl Africa's highest point world's highest freestanding mountain One of the world's largest volcanoes world heritage and wonder of africa I couldn't read that I could But i was talking to david another guy that was on the trip. He's like, yeah, dude I don't I don't remember a lot from the top. I mean we remember being there if we got my buddies 50th birthday We took hats baseball caps up there that said 50 We all wore our 50 caps for a photo but in terms of like remembering everything didn't remember a lot and so then Once we did that, I'll I'll send you a text of the photo right here Once we did that Shedrax says congratulations, you know, we had a meeting we knew you could do it We decided as a group that you guys were going to make it and you did congratulations and then he walked over to the side And there's a young man named uh charles. He was the strongest porter. I learned later He's 20s or so He walked over and he had a he had a big gas cylinder And he set the gas cylinder down and then all the guides built an igloo of backpacks around the gas cylinder And they started boiling water and I got off the thermocouples and I handed them the shed rock And he started boiling water and we boiled the water on the top of kilimanjaro and we took our measurements And uh, we had all made our guesses to what it was going to be And he said the value is this we were going to say that it boiled at this temperature I said thank you very much and recorded the temperature And then he said very good and then we broke it down and then we got down quickly because you you don't spend a lot of time At the top They say that For the guides The hard part starts once you summit because you have your clients from alabama And they have all kinds of adrenaline to get to the top of the mountain, right? But then they summit and then they have this huge adrenaline dump And they still got to get in our case about 4000 feet down the mountain Right and he said we're gonna have a hard time after summit. I said why? And I said, oh, it's adrenaline. I think it was yes, then we started down So I feel reverence listening to the story Thank you for not doing the thing you do sometimes where you get uncomfortable because The balance of the conversation is tilting your way. It needed to tilt your way I had nothing to offer this conversation once you got past 14 3 Nothing I I learned I listened What a beautiful experience. Yeah, you got down safely. We did You've had time to think about it. Why did you do it? What did you learn? Are you different? One of the main reasons I wanted to do it is because you know, you and I made a we made an episode a long time ago called congratulations on a life with chapters Your words your title. That's what you said to me when I stopped working full-time at the arsenal. You said congratulations on a life with chapters and When my buddy tie asked me and several other families like hey, is this something you'd be interested in doing? I realized that we are in a chapter right now in life You get to do life with different groups of people Right like there are people in your community. I know them by name great ice cream shop there Like you do life with people where you're at There's certain things that bond you together. Maybe it's your church. Maybe it's your family Having friendships in adulthood is a difficult thing and it requires maintenance and something you have to work on When my friend tie boom, I've done tons of stuff with when he said hey, is this this is something we're considering doing? What are your thoughts? I was just like frankly that sounds like pain in the butt is what I thought I was like man, that sounds like a ridiculous amount of effort It sounds like it will require training that involves time. I don't have because life is busy Then I was like we're in the middle of life with this family and these other families that are considering this and maybe we're not like Bestest best friends in the whole world, but we are very very good friends and we love each other and we care for each other We're in small groups. We do sports with everybody I was like I gotta do this for the friendship like I've got to do this for The investment in the relationship because if you don't have relationships with others, what do you have? Like what I'm like. What do you want in life money? What is it you want in life? This was an incredible investment in terms of time in terms of finances Like this is not something you just do you you prepare for it all the ways And then you do it and then at the end I just remember looking at my buddy on top of the mountain and being like You remember that stupid idea you had eight months ago. You just did it. Why? I'm not really sure right now because my brain's not working But we did it And then we we got down the mountain and we have stories For this little group of people like there's a lady that was there that coaches my Kids at this particular thing they do and I have stories with her about getting on a mountain, right? You know We have all these things, you know One of the funniest things was on day four we had fish to eat And the question was where do you get a fish at 14,000 feet on Kilimanjaro? I'm sure it's fresh, you know that we have jokes about these that's going to go forward It was almost like a mountain top experience with the relationships But I feel like it's going to stay there Like they got to see what I do when I'm hurting I remember I had one day I didn't drink enough water. I had a bad headache Somebody came to me and I worked with his son some stuff. He's like, are you how are you feeling? And I just looked at him. I said, I'm feeling really bad. I'm not okay He's like, okay. I was honest with him. I didn't do the alabama thing.
