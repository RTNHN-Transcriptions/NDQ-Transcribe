Okay, so I have been wanting to do this for so very long How do I even set this up? Well, let me help We're in the same room in Alabama and you're Scattering about curiously with your family. Yes, okay, and I'm just sitting here alone in this room With these headphones on so I don't know. I don't know what you're doing. Okay, so I've got three kids in the other room Okay, and the way I would say this is Parenting we all make choices, right? Yeah, so you make a decision about what Christmas traditions for example You might do with your family. I make decisions about what Christmas traditions I might do with my family sure people in the third chair do the same thing so One of the things I have told my children From the moment they could think I said daddy will never lie to you. I Will not lie to you and so there's all kinds of reasons. I do this however However, there is something that's happening in my family And I have elected to Never lied to my children. Therefore, I'm not participating my three oldest children are doing something With my youngest child And I am being very clever about how I participate so that I can always say I've never lied to you youngest daughter However, it's hilarious and I'm letting it happen Okay, and so somehow I am about to experience as cold without knowing anything about what's going on from the mouths of the people who are Participating is that set up? That's exactly what we're about to do. Can we go back to the lying thing real quick? What lion thing lying yeah, I'm not doing it. Okay, are you allowed to trick them? Yeah, you can trick them you can mess with them But like when they go back and they replay it in their brains like at the end of the usual suspects. They're like wait you lied. Oh You you now that wasn't a lie You let me think that for the sake of the trick like that's okay. That's okay All right, and also you can do things to help them become more clever But like if there's ever a daddy is this true Then I'll just tell them straight up if it's true or not That did factor in to what we're about to learn about my family game on So welcome to the room three oldest children of mine Good to see you guys Feel like I'm outside looking at it something here Feeling a little nervous. There's something you don't know about our family. That's Matt That's probably for the best there can be things I don't know so Just for the third chair. So my oldest daughter is here my You're 16. I've got my 14 year old son here and my 10 year old son and Yeah, how do you want to do this? How should we let mr. Matt know what's been going on? Well, that was a really good tease right there From daughter number one what don't I know? We actually have an older brother that you don't know about His name is Harold Wilbur force Samlin really? Where's he been all this time cuz I feel like I know you all real well and it seems like I would know that spinning college What college? New Mexico State University. He goes to New Mexico State. What's the mascot there at New Mexico State? Yeah, no, it's not we don't know we haven't been in contact with him. Yeah, okay Since he went to college four years ago sure four years ago Strange because of how well I knew you four years ago to be clear how old is your youngest sister? seven seven, okay Okay, so what is I'm sorry the name again over here. What was the name again Harold? Wilbur force Samlin Harold Wilbur force Samlin that just rolled right off the tongue is though. Yeah, okay, and What is he majoring in there at New Mexico? doctor's degree Okay. Yeah, so he's going to New Mexico and he's majoring in doctor's degree Okay And he's he's getting a master's a bachelor's degree. So he's been gone for a while. Oh, so he's doing he's doing the whole thing Cool. Yeah, one of those all at once packages that makes sense gonna be there for a long time Yeah, what city in New Mexico is that particular university and again? Albuquerque really Yeah, some kind of extension or something it is at the Albuquerque extension Small version of it. That's a small name. Okay, sure. Yeah, go New Mexicans I mean, we all all right. All right. Let me let me save the room here. So why don't you explain? How this came about to mr. Matt? I'll let you go first. Okay. Well, would you like to see a picture of him? Why did I not ask that first I asked what the mascot of his college was oh my goodness? Well He's a looker. There's one more and that's very promising for you He reminds me There was a Disney clone actor created in a lab in the late 1980s named Zac Efron hmm, he was on a lot of their programs and He I mean just for the third chair. He reminds me a lot of the Disney actor Zac Efron. Yeah, yeah, he's Harold well and Like right down to the haircut spit an image if I'm to be completely truthful. I know your parents really well and Actually before I even met you guys I thought if they had a kid I bet it would look almost exactly like Zac Efron and Now I see that again my intuition in terms of what married couples will produce proves to be accurate So that's him. That's yeah, what was the name again Harold Harold. It was his middle name Wilberforce Well, just cuz just cuz that's just what we let's what they thought of that's what my dad thought of Okay, yeah, so how they work. Yeah. Yeah, have you ever asked your dad is that a family name? I Don't know we have our dogs are named kind of weird things. So it's the same thing with Harold. Yeah, right naturally here's the way this went down so we were hanging out one day and I forget which child it was Decided that it would be was it you it was me. What did you say? I'm getting it. I convinced my little sister. I said we we have an older brother his name is Harold and Then I kind of let my older sister and my younger brother in on it and they just went with it and Yeah, this was like during a football game too. So all the family is there and everyone just played a wall Even the great uncle Steve who came up with the name Yeah, to be clear have your mom and I ever participated in this they say they don't lie to their children But they don't tell her that it isn't real does that count morally their third party because I So basically You guys lied to your sister, right? Yeah, that created a whole Host of issues for me really yes Yeah, and that does make you uncomfortable when I do the dry Mountain West man of the North humor This just put on a straight face and see it say an absurd thing that clearly is not the case and the joke is I Trust that you're savvy enough to know that I'm joking sir Like one time I was doing that with some people I joked about how they don't do parents in the West well from Wyoming Where I'm from they just sometimes you're raised by wolves you put your right hand on the back of my elbow and Said to the gentleman. We were talking to at your church. He's joking But it made you so uncomfortable makes me uncomfortable How I would not I would not call that a lie so so what I've enjoyed about this is I've enjoyed watching you guys As she's getting older wait getting older when did this start like last year? Yeah, it's been going she's believed that she has a sibling She's never met and who is in good standing with the family for a year about that They grew around the pond Wait believed it is she's still being there corned off she believed okay, okay? Yeah Yeah, oh about that So there's something about being a child and just believing things is beautiful right it's credulity What does that mean? It's wonderful. Well if somebody's incredulous, okay? They absolutely do not believe that okay? You don't use the normal version of the word very often but credulity, okay? Yeah, so she believes so there's a couple things that you guys have done to make this more elaborate, right? Like what kinds of things he loves barbecue? Oh? With Alabama white sauce or more like Memphis or St. Louis. What kind of barbecue barbecue sandwiches? Yeah What else what else is this backstory his birthday is June 5th? 2000 really is a 22 year old cut well he's into grad school. I didn't know I didn't know his birthday was June 5th Hmm. We also have his phone upstairs. You know, there's a there's an issue with that You know mom and dad got married in 2003 That Yeah, so that that does add a degree of trickiness that makes it a little strange There's gonna be some explaining to do when she gets a little older. I think I don't think she knows that though If we've already decided to just go with lion just change it. I didn't know that Yeah, just change it to four. Okay, we might have said it's 2004. See you just there salt people forget things. Yeah, there you go I'll help your kids lie. What about the what about the pin pack your help them lie? I won't what about the pin pal situation what His his youth leader actually heard about this and decided that he would be his he would be Harold So we would send letters to Harold. Oh Hey, oh dear and how many letters have we received from Harold? So there's been one letter that was written, but we don't think it ever got mailed We lost it so we don't have any letters from Harold yet. So right now she doesn't think Harold is real And so like we we gotta oh we're working on Like sending a letter to him to make sure that she knows he's real How do you explain away Harold not showing up for Christmas? Oh, he doesn't get off for Christmas, right? Giving strict school. Why wouldn't yet, New Mexico State. That's I mean notoriously rigorous program rigorous Like they're down there border country like that. Yeah, they're not letting you out for a holiday not after what they've been through right okay, I Feel like this all things hanging by a thread I Don't know if you're ever gonna be able to get her back on board with this now that she doubts it There's some pretty serious holds to this story She doubts it because the letter wasn't sent. She think we purposely didn't send the letter and Just like hope that she would continue to believe have you what's it addressed to so are you saying she sent a letter to Harold or Harold sent a letter to her? She wrote a letter for Harold that we accidentally lost she literally wrote a letter for Harold and and a drawing What was the drawing? Oh? What she wrote I don't have a brother anymore You monsters She wrote a let she just drop sure for him What does the matter with you people what did the letters say do you remember that she wrote Harold? I'd not remember but the picture was of her and Harold holding hands Was it really What color hair did Harold have in the picture you guys remember did he look like Zac Efron with jeans that ride right around the bottom of his hips And a super extra long tie and the swoosh of hair going across his forehead covering his eyebrows playfully of course yeah All right, so so where do you think this is going so you guys have done this for a while? She's getting smart right so what do you think the plan is here? Where are we going with this? Have you thought this through young man? youngest son have you just Extrapolate in your mind tell me where this is going. I don't think it's going anywhere. How do you see this ending? Not ending Well if she doesn't believe it anymore, I think it's over at hurry Yeah, but if she doesn't believe it then she probably won't believe it yet. What could you do to change that? I don't know. Let's just say that you had to get her to believe it. What would you do? We could end up sending letters like ourselves to Harold as like we hope to see you But we know your school is really strict. It sounds like a civil war era letter Yeah, dearest brother Harold It is with deepest regrets that we must celebrate this Christmas season apart from you our hearts do yearn for your presence Yeah, okay, so here's the thing about letters Not a lot of people do that what about other means of communication that you might be able to employ That could be more convincing he doesn't have a phone his friends do He doesn't why doesn't Harold have a phone because when he was moving to college he accidentally left it at our house And so he and it died forever forever Yeah, it's flip and mara youngest sister found it And she asked us what it was and we just said it was Harold's fan Are you talking about that little toy phone she plays with? Yeah, you've told her that's Harold's phone. We told her that's Harold She's gonna charge that thing up and go through the contacts What he at some point she's gonna figure it out. She's gonna find a micro USB charger Okay, so here's the question are you worried that this might damage trust with your sister? I'm not I'm not at all. Can you speak to why you're not? Not really. I don't really know why so it might Okay, it's very possible. Okay, that was the least Least convincing statement of reassurance. I've maybe ever heard let me just review what just happened Your dad asked the question are you at all concerned? This might damage trust long-term with your sister You all said no not at all. I said why is that and you all said well We do not have reasons per se She forgets very quick. Okay, that's a reason now. We're getting somewhere. Yeah. I don't think she's gonna forget this Harold thing I don't think this is going away You gotta do something to get rid of Harold Are you guys gonna kill Harold? No, I mean I hate to say I have to no I hate to even suggest it guys Why would you kill Harold? He has to go no, he's a fugitive running from all and he moves down to Mexico. Yes. Yes Or Brazil Are you guys making this up on the fly right now? This is real You know, we just got a text message from Harold with the phone he doesn't have Okay, so big picture then we went through three options just now option one kill him option two teller option three deeper down the rabbit hole and come up with more ideas, but you said something interesting there on option two and that is It was a teller and that's how we would let her off the hook but what about the old psychological adage that it is Easier to convince someone of a lie in the first place than it is to convince them they have been lied to in other words It's just it's tough to get somebody to realize that they got tricked on something might it might be hard for her to let it go It's like the sunk cost fallacy because you're like, oh, that means I was dumb. Yes Okay Well, we're all going down together. So I love that So you guys would you say you're scamming your sister or you're having fun with her? How would you say it? We're just messing around What's it? What's it between that and a scam? Um a scam is wanting something from you. We don't want anything from her. We're not going for her money What are what are you going for? What do you what do you get out of it entertainment? Okay, yeah So youngest son, what what's fun about it to you? Why is it entertaining? Because we get to watch her ask questions about him that we get to make up That felt pretty honest sure did I mean, it's it's oddly all felt pretty honest Even though at its heart. It's a complete deception It's an interesting dichotomy that way. Yeah, it's interesting. So I thought this is pretty interesting So sandlin family we we know about this thing that happens during christmas, right? Yeah, okay, and you know some families do some things christmas and some families don't right Do we do it or not do it? We don't don't we do not how does that make you feel That mommy and daddy didn't do that one with you. We filled that hole with herald All right, I think that's pretty good I think that's pretty good. All right. Well, I love you kids. Thank you very much Well, we're gonna talk to your little sister now and see what she has to say is there anything you want us to ask her Ask her what he thinks about barbecue What herald favorite food? Okay And she's how old again? Seven I to recap option number one for where you guys are currently at strategically is make something happen to herald That could be very emotionally scarring for little girl option number two Is come out and tell her And when I pitch that idea to you you're like, well, just tell her that's how we do it I'm like, but what if she's already in too deep? What if you can't commit so we went down that road we considered that option number three Is we just take a little bit further down the rabbit hole here And we just wait until she grows up enough to figure it out for herself if and i'm not proposing this But if hypothetically I were to help you think of some ideas to go further down the rabbit hole What kind of ideas do you think we might want to start poking around it? We need to bring in uh, sac ephron impersonator. Oh my goodness. That has to be a thing and we've been trying to get our uncle to Photoshop a photo of zac heffron on a new mexico states student With the t-shirt on everything Okay Okay I don't really know what we could do What about having a series of zoom calls that you schedule cleverly to just end As your mom and your sister are coming in the door If you could do that I mean there doesn't even have to be anybody on the other end of the zoom call you could just record somebody saying gotta go Love you all bye-bye And then you're just there and like bye-bye and you're just talking to a video This is true the letter thing is not going to work There's even a child knows no one writes letters. How many other people do you write letters do? We're required to write letters. Okay, that's pretty great. That's pretty great There's one thing we need to for you to do. Oh when she comes in here And if she asks any questions about harold make something up And then we need you to tell us that after it. I don't know that I'm prepared to Yeah, but jerry's still out for me mr. Matt to participate in the legend that is harold loberforce sandlin. It's a privilege. It's a myth Well, that's different. Wait. Wait. What's the difference between a legend and a myth? A legend could be real or could not be real and a myth just is made up We all know that a myth is just like something to teach a lesson Do you guys ever hear the one about um that little boy who lied about the wolves? Yes Okay, no, I mean unrelated just Just thinking That was a metaphor Yeah, okay the honest assessment This is I mean it's tricky because this is really fun But I need to tell you I'm not above it. So one time we had a field trip to the denver zoo And we came home from the denver zoo. We were all in the vehicle together And remember I was in the back is a dotson 210 it's a hatchback. It had wood on the sides Um side note, that's what I learned how to drive in stick shift dots and be 210 That's so cool. Yes orange really my was yeah kind of like rust colored. That's really neat It's just another thing that we got that's fantastic. So we're driving along in the dotson 210 and mom looks back and says well, how was the zoo? And I without looking up from my book said It was nice, but most of the animals had died And Mom and dad in the front seat shook their heads in disappointment And my brother warmed all the way up Realizing what I just said looking at me He said They did and his eyes were shiny Because there was just there's just a little bit of tear forming up And then mom could hear the little quiver in his voice. It was like now your brother is just Like let me at least run a little bit further with this the point is I only made up one thing and my brother was 80 percent of the way to the dam breaking and tears coming down his sweet cheeks. So Your dad's question about like are there any long-term ramifications here. I'm just saying it's worth thinking about that We're all going going down together And the only reason we got my smart group later in on this is because When he was like 18 his sister he has a sister and she was she was also like about 18, okay, and His sister looks exactly like his mom and he looks nothing like either of his parents Oh no And he convinced his sister that she was a dog. Oh no Oh Oh no Like you're striking the like the stuff that makes people who they are So Okay, I know I know a more harmless version of this prank that another family Friends of ours pulled They convinced their two youngest boys that they had already been to disney world And every time they asked to go to disney world they were like again What? Yeah, we went we saved up forever But they were like you they never really lied They'd always just framed the pitch so it wasn't like yeah, disney world was super expensive back then That was a lot of savings. We had to oh and they said we've already been they meant they had already been correct the we yeah, so they they just it was a is a brilliant play and I think those kids are your age And they still think they've been to disney world Which now i'm just going to throw this out it raises a question for me that i've need the three of you to think about What things might you think are real? The are actually things that have been inceptionized upon you without the use of lying Just something to think about while you're going down this road your mother and I actually do love you We don't just say that okay Okay, it's good. Yeah, is there is there anything you suspect Might be an elaborate long-term prank being played upon you and this whole setup here where i'm playing dumb Is actually just a way with mics on to break the thing to you finally What do you think dad? I think your your brother's face right now hilarious What's about that happened? We have no idea Now i'm confused what would would I do something like that to you? Yes, absolutely. Why would I do that because it's funny It would be funny if such a thing were happening So this is why this is hard for me I've worked a tremendous amount of time in my life to make you kids funny like I want you to be funny Right, it's working, but I also want you to not lie And I don't want to lie to you and this is hilarious So i'm in a tough spot here because this is absolutely hilarious and i'm so proud of the story that is Harold will before sandlin That I just don't want it to stop. That's where i'm at So yeah, what do you have to say about that? I agree. I don't want it to stop it Well, here's what I think we should do. I think we should Let you guys go and then we'll go I guess interview your sister and see where she's at with this whole thing. What do you think about that Matt? I can't wait This is gonna be precious This episode of note on questions is brought to you by raycon raycon makes earbuds that we both use all the time And that we like dessin. What do you like about raycons? I like that they charge in the little little package like you charge The thing it's got a usbc connector on it you plug it up and then it charges the little pill. I call it There's i don't know. It's like a little Plastic folding pouch kind of thing. I'm just gonna kill to a shell shell. Yeah shell. Maybe yeah like a little clam shell kind of thing so it charges in that and I don't know it's like got magnets in all the right places so when it closes it snaps shut Whoever designed it got all the haptic feedback correct like the way you yeah It clicks and pops and all all the things it just feels good And I like it and I like the fact that the outside is that almost rubberized plastic So it feels good in the hand. I like raycons They're high quality and how they're made mechanically And i've been doing a lot of work on that kind of stuff lately injection molding and stuff like that So I like to think about how the raycons were made They're cost effective too. So if you're on through the washing machine not that i've done that five times I have never Killed a set of raycons in the washing machine You're not like allowed to say that they're waterproof or anything But all I can say is I've never killed a pair on the washing machine What are your thoughts? All I can say is mine are very clean I think of that whatever you want. You're not allowed to say to put it. Yeah, exactly now I finally did wreck my first pair so I've got Six at this point then I just got Camilla the rose gold ones And I've got I mean I share them with my kids and then I've got one for each vehicle So just I always always always have them And if we take a car or a call rather in the vehicle we can pop that in and kind of Lean away from the family and chat a little bit and that's another thing in the early going They didn't really have the microphone side of things integrated and figured out and I didn't I just used them for listening exclusively Now I take calls on the rayconsels have them in for a good chunk of the day and listen to the things I want to listen to audio books or whatever But then also if a call comes in it works great for that as well. Well, what is your ear hole size Is it like standard? Your hole or do you have to change adapters? I don't because it comes with a little pack of adapters Do you have a no, but I don't want to brag it's really big So you have to step up the yeah, this is like yeah big big big ear holes. I hear a lot and That's a curse you hear a lot Yeah I hear a lot impress my friends intimidate my enemies. I think you understand what I'm saying. Hi big ear holes What are you gonna do right? I understand what you're saying. Well, tell me about when you hear a lot what sound profiles do you hear with? What a mistake way Why does anyone listen to this? Because it's quality go ahead. Oh my goodness. No, that was good. That was good. Yeah, well Let's do talk about the sound profiles I listen to the bass one because it sounds good to me and I like music that has bass Then I particularly like the bass line on things because I enjoy playing the bass guitar So I use that profile the most. What about you? I just go with the normal like the I usually don't change the profiles. How do you how do you change it? You Hold the left earbud for three seconds And then I think I'm I just tells you what profile you're in now, but you can hear the difference you can figure it out pretty easy You got the pure sound you got the balance sound you got the bass sound I listen to the bass you know what I think about a lot What the lady that recorded the I've tried to figure out how to record Her sound but I can't but she it says raycon power on there's a lady that recorded that voice It's like a voiceover actress And I've often wondered like who is that person Yeah, but it's becoming pavilobian for me when that turns on it's like all right.

I hold them all in the highest of the steams Uh secondly, it's baffling that I have never heard of you and till today. I've never seen a photograph of you I've never heard any mentions about you.

It's just an absolute pleasure to finally make your acquaintance Well, I'm glad to be here I like Harold's voice So meek and nice. Yeah, I know right so, um, what the heck is going on? So my understanding is that uh My children wrote you a letter harold is that correct and you received it? That is correct. It came in the mailbox Okay, would you uh would you please read the letter that you received for my my children? I will it says dear harold it is your younger brother and your youngest sister We would like to know if you have gotten a phone yet and if so, what is your phone number? What is your favorite color? Your youngest sister would like to know how much longer you were in college Will you please write us back your siblings? ps Do you like barbecue? And it has a lovely picture of what I believe is the two of us picking apples Just having a very good time And to be clear you did write a response to this letter. Oh, yes. I did write a response Okay, so uh matt. I have a recording Of the moment in my truck when we got wait the letter And you mailed the letter through the united states postal service actually due to a lack of time I handed the letter to Destin son at church just last night Okay, did you put a return address on it? Oh, I did I very much did and Did you procure the name of the city in which new mexico state university is located to see through this all properly? Yes Luckily spelling is a whole lot easier than pronunciation Uh, so the city that new mexico state is in is los cruces. Yeah, oh my los cruces Yeah, that's right. We've been very thorough. I'm impressed No stamp though. I noticed there was no stamp. Yeah, I told I told your son last night He may want to procure a stamp Uh to make it look believable So when he pulled it out sometimes it was fall off he pulled it out in the truck to read to her She said there's no stamp and he said the loss must be different in new mexico Just uh, but I did universal posted. Yeah, buddy I did actually uh turn on my phone recorder to record the moment that it was opened and read to my daughter So I'll play that for you now Wait, wait, what is this? This is a letter from harrow And we sent a letter to him Okay, uh, it says unfortunately I still don't have a personal phone or an email New mexico state university is quite their strict on encouraging us to focus on our studies It all goes according to plan. I should graduate in the spring of 2024 How old are you guys now? It seems unreal how long it's been since I've been in Alabama I do like barbecue, but it's not as near as good as here as it is back home My favorite color is agie crimson. You're sibling harrow p.s. Tell mom and dad I said hi go agies Go agies. Who are the agies? Is that new mexico state? I think yeah, I think the agies are new mexico I'm looking at it. Can I look at it? I want to see what's on here already. That means it's not a kid Oh Is there anything on the back? Okay, that means it might actually be from now because I told you that it would be great if Here's something on the back What happened? There's nothing on the back Oh That means that if if it was used then you would have acted like you did See I did not write this letter How would it come in our newspaper saying you wrote our name on it and our address on it What's your question? What's your question? Yeah, why did say you knew? That's New Mexico. That's the abbreviation for New Mexico No, Mexico's from there There's no stamp on it. So that means there's different laws in New Mexico than there is in Alabama So that means there's probably um no just like no stamp laws in New Mexico Interesting. Is there a way you can tell if it's a real letter? If there is, can you check? Can I check? I don't know a way If you tell me away, I'll do it. Easy peasy Uh I'm hungry. Y'all want to get some food? Yes, let's get some food The whole thing is just a treat and I respect how much you're all committed to seeing this thing through But listen to that little squeaker's voice. I know her and her soft little heart I mean, you all are making it seem like she has a brother. I'm pretty sure she doesn't have at this point Did you feel any kind of compunction? Morally about writing a letter like that to a teeny tiny squeaky little girl Yeah, I guess I should reveal that this isn't actually harrow on the phone. This is my friend chappy Oh, hey Yeah, okay. I'm look. I'm just gonna level with you. I had that one I I had done the math that you were not harreled Though I did not know who you were so but I've heard a lot about you. We haven't met in person Nice to phone meet you nice to phone meet you as well um It was certainly troubling to be part of toying with a young girl and what she understands to be true but after I realized more of the landscape of things Certainly made it exciting to play along with the bit fair enough Chappy, thank you so much You have invested a tremendous amount in my family's life. I'm grateful for that. Thank you for working with my son at church all the things Um, yeah, so thank you. You're very welcome. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to do that So matt there's a couple more layers to the onion that I think Um, you'll be interested to peel back with me. So let's go do that now. Sounds good All right, I'm happy matt to Be joined here in the spare bedroom with the microphone set up by my beautiful seven-year-old daughter. How are you doing? Good doing good. All right. You know this guy's name That's right That's right. I've known you since forever as you understand forever to be He's known you a long time. Do you ever not remember mr. Whitman? Like do you ever remember a time in your life when you didn't know that he existed? When I was born. Yeah, okay. That's a good point There's probably a lot of people you didn't know existed back then. Yeah, exactly. All right, so what we're going to talk about is Something that your brother and brother and sister were telling us about which is Harold Harold Does Harold love a middle name? What's Harold's middle name? No, it's not danger. They call them Harold Wilberforce Wilberforce So we're going to talk about Harold And right now I know that you're a smart little girl and I know that you're doing little things in your head Your deity is about him You're trying to figure out how I want to talk about Harold, aren't you? Yeah, so mr. Matt is in on our secret you and I have a secret about Harold. Don't we? Mr. Matt knows our secret. I think here. I'm going to tell him our secret What well, well, tell mr. Matt. He doesn't know he's not real They made him up What even mom and dad wait your dad told you that you had a brother named harreld Wilberforce with those words He's not real my mom even says it and if she had Had gave birth to him or adopted him She would know he was real and if if he didn't well Yeah, so so your older brother and your other brother and your sister told us he doesn't like barbecue He doesn't like barbecue. I thought he loved barbecue. That's what they said. He doesn't like it at all Okay, one time her friend tried to give him it and he smacked it on the floor. Whoa, really? Yeah So what are they doing with harreld? What are what are they kind of doing trying to make me believe? Yes, they are. Yeah, and then you did something one time you came up to daddy and you said daddy What did you say? He's haired. We and what did I say? No, he's not real. So that's simple. And so I tried to trick my My brothers and sisters to think I believed so I wrote a letter and drew a picture of him And so I said Will you put this in the mail? She said sure next day I come back to her Did you send it and she said um What she did what she she didn't because she said I don't know his address So what's she doing? She's trying to make me think that she doesn't know it but she doesn't know it at all because he's not real So do you see what we're doing here man? I mean Yes, yes, I do. Yes, it's pretty good It's great I love it. So so they think you're tricking that they're tricking you But i'm tricking that That's right. Oh, this is gold. Isn't it? This is wait a minute. They haven't you seen pictures of harreld wool before sandal? Nope You've never seen a picture. Nope. Well, they've shown you some pick they've shown you some pictures and told you that it was him Right, but it was not okay. Who was it? It would I don't know but it was the same they showed you a bunch of pictures of the same person over and over and over Dad, I don't think they ever showed me a picture. Oh, okay. All right. Cool. Yeah, I don't know if they did but they might have It might be yeah, it might be I think at this point. It's just a part of the legend They built this legend up in their mind And they want it to be like they think that they're tricking you really really really well But not at all not at all but you've done a good job Of letting them think that they tricked you right? Yes, sir, but you haven't lied to them I think I think that's interesting. What you've been doing is you've been asking questions instead of being like um Carol's real or That would be lying So i've been asking questions instead like Can you send this letter? Why doesn't he like barbecue? I asked why does it doesn't he like barbecue? So you never lie It still counts It still counts Well, what did you put in your letter to him? I don't know Oh, you don't remember what it said. Did you draw my picture? On it? Yeah And you're me and a guy with a beard And hair on his head He wasn't bald. I don't think yeah, it's pretty interesting, right? So what do you think about this whole herald thing? Do you think that they're trying to trick you like what just in general? What do you think about this whole thing? They're trying to make me think that I have another brother. Is that good or bad? I don't get it What do you mean? Is it a good thing that they're doing this or is it a bad thing that they're doing this? It's a bad thing because they're kind of like oh, I think they're kind of straight-up lying to you Why do you think they're doing this? I don't know I think they think it's fun that I don't know So you think it's fun for them? Yes, sister's geevious I've seen that. Yeah, I know some geevious people He's joking because the word is mischievous. Why would you fix that? Missed you just added a word to my vocabulary and it's chevious If you can be mischievous, you should be able to be chevious Sure Should work both ways. It's incredulous incredulous right? Same concept. Okay, so Do you think that what they're doing is mean? No, so it's not so it's not means not what is it? Do you think? I think it's funny for them Is it funny for you? After having been on the receiving end of a prank of a trick Do you think you might ever try to trick somebody else? I Think I know what that means, but no, I will not try to trick someone else. I will try to question someone else Uh-huh. Okay. I think it's kind of fun to play along though. Don't you? Yeah, it is really fun It's fun to pretend that there's a person named Harold It would be more fun if you were in on the pretending right And you kind of are in on the pretending just a little bit different than what they were you know They're thinking it is right there trying to make me think it but I'm basically Trying to make them think I didn't have no idea how I explained it. Can we do a little bit of strategizing together? Sure Thank you How do you want to reveal to them one day that you knew all along? How are you gonna tell them? Booyah You're just gonna say that Booyah here is not real I think we're done here. I think we are at the end of college if he doesn't come home. How do you have proof? That's a great point. It's a great point well Let's say That a couple of years from now you tell them finally and guess what guys I knew there was no Harold all along Forgot the booyah and the hand gesture that accompanies it Then for the third chair she's food her hands like a big gangster pose like boy It's just a little bit of girl. So that what do you think they're gonna say when you tell them that What do you mean? What do you mean here it is real And then they just make something up um He got married at college and he's living with someone else And then I and then I would say but why wasn't I invited to the wedding if you were yes Yes, so how are you gonna prove to them that you knew all along? Booyah I have a way that we could prove Mr. Matt has a holling that Calling in that's one way, but they would just say But we don't know his phone number I would like to try something if I may real quick. This is just my phone here. Yes. It's got It's got a camera on it. Yes. Um Is it okay if I hit record for a minute? Sure. I'm just gonna make quick video What day is it today? December 31st 2022 good job. That's excellent. And how old are you? Seven and a half that you were I'm going to turn eight and are you of sound mind? That means is your mind working correctly Kind of I'm a little crazy No, you're not you're joyful. You your mind is working excellent. Okay, then yes Okay So being of sound mind on this 31st day of December 2022 What message would you like to record that we could play back for your siblings later on when you reveal to them that you knew all along? Mm Did you know all along that there was no harrel? Yes And so even right now is we're recording this you know that there's no harreled. Yes Sir. So who is the actual joke on here? Who's getting tricked? Are you being tricked or are they being tricked? There Do you think I did an okay thing by letting them play for a while? Yeah, but you know I the fun needs to end sometime does it? Do I so as the dad do you think that it's okay that I've let them continue to think that they're fooling you even though they're not? Yeah, because you need some more time to trick them. Oh, okay. It's been fun for me too. Well, let me ask you this. Is daddy ever lied to you? No, why? Because he never was less than anyone. I just well, I have lied before but uh just yeah like you said yeah once oh, yeah I remember a very specific lie the perfume one that was one of them on the fifth grade He put a lot of perfume on that his dad had in the closet And this guy he put so much he just went Everywhere on his body just like in those cartoon things But then he walked to school and well first he smelt it and he was like, oh man and so he walked to school and there is A guy that walked up and said did you put your dad's perfume on and he said No, I said it spilled out of the closet and landed on me, right? Yeah, but that wasn't the truth that wasn't the truth and you just went and I lied And I knew I lied the moment I did it and I called my teacher years later because I had remembered I had never Asked him or I never basically confessed right? So I remember calling as an adult Like my fifth grade teacher and it's like hey, it was either you or my guidance counselor But I told you that I had like dropped a cologne on me But I actually sprayed it all over me and that's bugged me for years and I just need to tell you that You don't think there's some kind of statute of limitations on fifth grade lies It was just important to me. It was very important. All right. Yeah Yeah, also I lied about stealing the M&Ms When I was like three years old I stole the M&Ms out of the jar And mom and dad were like did you take the M&Ms? I'm like nope and there's chocolate on my face I did I stole those M&Ms. I switched to sticker on cassette tape that I wanted I had like $8.45 and it was 8.99, but there was another sticker right next to it. It said 7.99. Whoa I just switched the sticker in that discount because that been and you know it too, don't you? And so does the person who I did it too because I did the same thing I called him back like a boy scout years You probably don't remember me Now that I have kids I cut Support I think that's important. I did that. Yeah, I did that but you know who I never called back kiddo My fourth grade teacher to tell her that that wasn't milk. I spilled on my pants Whoa, was it? She probably knew my mom made me these really nice corduroy pants and I couldn't the button there was something wrong The button wasn't designed properly. I remember the story and there was nothing I could do there was nothing I could do I mean I like a whole day dude Come on like you're allowed. Come on. You couldn't just got the scissors You know what that's it's not bad. That's a good. I don't know how I would have resealed my No, not like that like cut this stuff that's around the button around the button Clip when you're done. Yes, good paper clip. Why didn't I do that didn't think of the paper clip? That's a good idea. I don't know if I could find everybody too. I lied to about that one though because there's a lot of people Yeah, I led with it too. Got on the bus. Hey, it's just milk. Hey everybody. Just like you know All the way down to the end to the last row Smells like pee. It's actually milk. So we're fine. It's weird. Oh, no that one so I just wanted I just wanted to have you on I just wanted to have you on to talk about Harold I thought mr Matt would find it enjoyable to know that you're in on it. Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, did you see that coming? No, you should have got the popcorn if you wanted to have a wild ride No, I didn't see it coming. I knew there had to be another twist Yeah, but I didn't know this was the twist and I was really nervous To get back on here and be like put yourself in my shoes. What do you want me to do here? Right. And so my plan was just to be quiet and nod a lot and make smiling sounds real close to the mic like this She didn't yeah Mr. Matt didn't know if you knew about Harold being not real. No, so he didn't know what to do I knew what to do with your siblings kind of Wait, what were they talking about? tricking you They were talking about the trick and at first they ran it like they were trying to trick me and that lasted for one Yeah, one questions worth of credibility They did not have their story mapped out very well. They did they actually didn't remember It's hard to remember all your lies, isn't it? Yep. Um, so should I let the siblings listen to this because they'll they'll know that you're in on it at that point. Yeah, but can I say one more thing? Yeah Thank you so much daughter This episode of notom questions is brought to you by you you being the patrons You being the people who listen to what we're doing here You understand what we're going for and you want to be behind it It means a ton if you want to join those patrons and supporting the program You can do that at patreon.com slash notom questions Seriously, it means a ton and it is the fuel that keeps us saying rolling forward. We really appreciate you Chappie either Here I am So to be clear you were in on this the whole time. Oh, yeah, um, this has been going Somewhere around six months uh between between you and your son I have been informed Every step along the way, which uh certainly made it easier to play along with Not not feeling like I was hurting anyone's Basically, you knew that harold wasn't real and you knew that the little one knew that and she was playing them Yes. Yeah her Knowing that I wasn't real is what set the hook for me to be involved Uh, I love being involved in there the humbling of young men And it all comes into focus. Oh, that's good. Okay Yep, I see it all now So to be clear you were playing my oldest son the whole time. Correct. Yes That was and to be clear he has it coming. Oh, yeah, definitely Good good. You can't mess with your sister that much No, not not to that level. Yeah, I think he's starting to cross some lines. I think so too Oh, you little genius It's pretty fun, right? It's pretty fun. Yeah, and so she has a thing like we turned what could have been an L into a w Oh, yeah, yeah, and so it's pretty cool. And so she's Like hey, it's your secret daddy's secret. And this is what we're gonna do, right? She's like, yeah Well, and this is how you out maneuver something either done harmlessly or maliciously at your expense It's a lesson in how to Outmaneuver that without going scorched earth and they aren't going scorched our earth on her That this is not meant to be hurtful or harmful to her at all It's really a gesture of inclusion and kindness and love from them toward her Like they're all in on it. It's the kind of war story that y'all laugh about when you're adult siblings later on But she's getting a bonus lesson out of it Which is instead of being the younger sibling who freaks out and feels powerless Here's how to use cleverness mental judo to flip the thing back around and And make the jokes serve a different purpose than what they thought. I think it's brilliant. Yeah My hope was that this would be something that long after i'm gone They could laugh about and they could remember that little game that we all played together on each other And dad was in on it and uh tara to her credit has From the first second it started happening. She's like i'm not lying to my daughter I'm out and so she's like i'm i'm out of this whatever happens. I'm out So okay, you've talked about it before real quick though Why we both agree don't lie to our kids. We don't lie to our kids either Clearly you and I define lie a little differently. We draw that line a little differently I'm leaving a lot more room for dry humor Stick things like that, but We agree on the principle A question that I don't think it's asked enough when you're talking about just ethics or moral absolutes is just why If it's definitely the right thing to do it should be easy for you to defend the policy Why don't you lie to your kids? It's a great question and the ultimate answer is I want them to know that their father is a person of integrity and so They can know that if he tells me something it's true Even if it's not something I want to hear it is true meaning In the future when they get older and in their upper teenage years, they're gonna have conflicts They're gonna have Relationship problems with you know boyfriends and girlfriends and stuff like that And if I want to maintain the level of access In their lives to be able to tell them hey straight up. You know, I'm not gonna lie to you, right? This is the case. This is not the person for you or This is like I'm telling you this Yes, it's your father But number one as the truth and the truth is this person will destroy your life And you need to hear me right now when I'm saying this because it's true and I've already seen this payoff My oldest daughter she had some conflicts in her life And she was really struggling with something I pulled her aside. I was like hey, here's the deal This is the truth and I told her the truth straight up And it's not what she wanted to hear and she's like, you know what? That is the truth because you wouldn't tell me something that wasn't the truth And it was just maintaining the level of access and influence over my children in such a way that I don't know super important. So that's why I do it And that's why we do things at christmas a certain way and that's right. Yeah, and it's why we say no to almost every sponsor Who approaches us even here right exactly if my kids listen to the show. I'm not If they see That I say we like this thing and I never actually use a thing That I say, oh, it's great people should you should buy this you should look it up and consider it and they know I hate it That hurts my household. Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. Yeah, I mean, that's the way we're choosing to play it and that cost That cost a lot. That cost money. Thank you patrons. Thank you patron. I think you patrony team that work. Yeah Making it Easier for us to do that seriously. I mean I was an aside, but now that you mentioned it. Yes I want to follow up on what you just said though because Look man in terms of the rare combination of engineer brain that gets used for social acuity you are Very socially attentive among the elite i've ever hung around with but you get there Through a different set of tools and in a weirder way than anybody i've ever been around You engineer reading other people and being empathetic. It's very odd most people I know who are good at that skill Are saturated in story and music and art and there's just this intuition and they feel it and They're just drenched in reading the classics and it's just like I aspire to be them They've got like a sixth sense about other people you have that too But you arrive at it You diagnose people's needs and insecurities and where they need encouragement Just differently you get there differently than other people it serves you so well that said I've seen you be wrong. Oh, yeah, really wrong on assessing people. I've seen you miss assess me I've seen you miss assess people we know together And because you're right 49 times out of 50 even on big bold quick assessments You know generally i'm gonna go with you but every now and then it doesn't pan out that way and you just saw it wrong me too So what happens If you go to your kid when they're in a crisis at age 17 age 18 you've banked all of this stuff and you say I always tell you the truth that person is trouble And then they weren't and it turns out that that person Was actually right and you read it wrong and you pushed the I tell you the truth chips to the middle On something that isn't necessarily truth or lie But is assessment and evaluation something that even though you hit more often than just about anybody I've ever met you're still human and you're still gonna miss on with them at some point How do you manage that? How do you factor that in so that if you do get an assessment wrong in front of your kids and you do play the truth card You still have that credibility the next time it's needed I don't know. I have it. I'm trying to think of times. I've played the truth card I can think of once And you were right Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was obvious like it was like any any adult with a function It would have been like you would think so But look at planet earth man Yeah, I don't know. I just want to maintain the level of access and influence in my children's lives that I think is You know, hopefully one day can help them. I don't know. Okay. What if without playing the truth card? You run into a situation where you're like, hey kid. This is what needs to happen here. I tell you the truth. This is the truth But you just happened to have read it wrong and it shakes out that both you and whichever kid you said that to realize Oh, you read it wrong. Where do you go from there? Like just how do you just tell me how do you move forward? Yeah? So um so it was the truth when you told them. This is exactly how I see it Yeah, I got it wrong. But then the truth when the details come out is I was wrong I just say I screwed up, you know, please forgive me. It was really interesting. There was a young When my daughter was really really young. I was telling her to do something in a group of kids and There's a guy named Wes and he said hey You should consider asking her to do that instead of telling her. Wow and I was like huh. I was like well She's got to do this and you know, I was I thought about it and I was like Huh, I don't negotiate with a four-year-old. You know, I was just like Interesting and so I said okay I'll consider that and I did and I carefully considered it and a week later I went back to that guy and I was like hey, Wes You told me that the way I said it was a little harsh and I should have said it this way. You were right Thanks for telling me that because you know, that's hard to say to somebody. So thanks for telling me that And uh, I thought that was interesting Just with my kids. I just try to Also be aware that I'm a human and I'm a center and I'm selfish and I have selfish ambition and pride and ego and all those things and When you're in the position of father It's easy to be like well, I'm the dad Why well because I said so that's that's kind of like the default that you think about and It's really really interesting to think of the fact that I screw up quite a bit So I don't know how we got here, but it's a thing. Well, I'm trying to differentiate between Right and the truth. Oh, yeah, so the truth is You telling the truth is your very best Squares to earnest read with the people in your innermost circle of trust your family About whatever's going on when it's prudent for you to open your mouth It would be dishonest of you to see a thing a certain way open your mouth and say the opposite of what you see Yeah, but you could be wrong and that's a different category That's what I'm trying to sort through is I I think A lot of times this I'm going to be committed to integrity thing that I think a lot of people I hope aspire to Can get confusing when you start intending to get it right, but you get it wrong And then maybe you feel some kind of pressure to double down on your misevaluation so that You know everybody still thinks you tell the truth when I when I loved your answer and I loved what you said That well if you were wrong. I was wrong is now the truth. You need to communicate Yeah, absolutely. So wrong is is okay. Yeah, there's tell the truth about that too. Yeah, yeah brilliant How do you try to present yourself to the kids when you're doing your best to discern the truth, but You're not sure And yet they need leadership from you. What do you do there? Yeah, it is very hard to figure out what the truth is sometimes and so Sometimes I lead with hey, you know, dads don't get it all right all the time, right? But this is As far as I can see this is the right thing to do right now Something along those lines is what I do. What are you doing that situation? Yeah, I don't think I say that but The conversation unfolds in such a way that I'm saying that unless I'm off my game In which case my lazy lazy I didn't carefully assess Decisions needed to be made and I wasn't in the best headspace and I just boom. This is the way the things are I'm sure like sometimes I'll hear a description of like something going on in an interpersonal dynamic You know somebody the kids know from sports or school or whatever and I'll be like, oh, they're like this That's what's going on And then I hear like the next two sentences and realize Yeah, just totally miss assessed that I'll give you a give you an example the kids were all playing the other day and We'd worked hard um, and we said okay, it's time for free time you guys can go do whatever you want and They should have took the cue like hey, I can literally go do whatever I want. Yes, you have earned it You can go do whatever you want. They leave the room Maybe two minutes later One of them screams like I'm injured. I'm hurt and I'm screaming and the other ones and then they're start screaming at each other like he did She said, you know, and they're all doing the stuff And I did the dad tornadoes into the room situation. Oh, yeah, I do that. Yeah. Yeah, I just what what are you doing? And then I said, everybody get in there right now because I wanted to just like get it away from mom Because like hey I just need to go stern dad right now. So I said look here's the deal you have free time You're fighting And then they were all like but it wasn't me it wasn't me And as I was watching how they were reacting I was in real time trying to figure out who was the actual instigators clue. Yeah, clue Yeah, play in the game clue. So I figured it out And when I figured it out, I figured out okay, these two parties are guilty those two parties are innocent they feel like they're being wrongly Accused of something these people were doing right now. So I just went all the way through with the discipline I was like, hey, this is the deal and the discipline was a stern talking to and you know angry dad eyes I know them that that I'm gonna make them at you now. Oh, oh stop. Please it hurts. Stop. Okay. So that was the discipline My angry dad eyes also have jaw Yeah, that's jaw like app. Yeah, there's also jaw. I don't do that. Okay. So um afterwards we said, okay You got it and they're like, yeah, I got it and they said, okay I said go do what you want. They all want to say hey youtube come here. I was like, I know exactly what just happened They did this And then you got in trouble for it. I'm aware of the situation. I just want you to know I saw what happened They tried to pretend like you were involved you weren't involved and I know that I just need you to know that I know it And they're like, okay. Okay, cool. So that was one time where I clearly got it wrong immediately And then just tried to like signal. Hey, oh with the initial burst. Yeah with the initial tornado. Okay. I'm trying Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't know I guess the answer is what I try to tell the kids is something I need to do as well When you're walking in the wrong direction Progress isn't about face And as soon as I realize I get the dead thing wrong, I try to turn it around I think I've told you before that when I was doing the counseling thing I would always especially premarital counseling I'd encourage couples with the measurement of the health of your relationship Is the amount of time that elapses between the moment you know you're wrong and you say you're wrong If you've got trust with each other And you're just absolutely humbled before each other you tell each other the truth all the time That time should be zero Flipping around it means you trust the other person to match the reduction in intensity the laying down of arms And to accept your acknowledgement of wrongdoing and to make it right and move forward If that time is a day a week a month, you need to come back and see me That's yeah, that's pretty good. I like that. Yeah, so that was good I mean your turnaround time was Awesome better than mine often is in that case in that one case. Yeah sure. Well, that's when you chose a talent I agree with that decision All of this to say The whole reason that I wanted to go a little bit down the rabbit hole here after having the conversations Is because I think it is very simple to be like black white truth falsehood. It's that like just there only say things that are true But when a ponches pilot says what i was thinking about pilot what is truth It's a it's a better question than he gets credit for from all the people in the bible who are rooting for jesus as they read it Like pilot. He's asking a valid question. Well Okay What do we mean like truth as we're about to declare it with the law because when I make a law does that just become truth when I declare a verdict Legally now the verdict is truth. What is what we talking about what actually happened You're hearing from a guy who's just worn down by the complexity of the question and an attempt on the part of His government is legal structures to oversimplify the thing And the reality is that at the most basic level You're right integrity with the kids and letting them see I would choose the word integrity over the word truth Letting them see that I think banks capital that is going to pay dividends in your ability to speak into invest in their lives forever But what you described in talking about getting things wrong so not truth you miss assessed but with good intentions That's still integrity That's still you trying to do what is right and you just misread it because you're human And then the way we you were describing what you do upon realizing that that's also integrity You can have no integrity and be saying things that are true So for me, I would just I would couch it just a little bit differently I think integrity is what you're going for. Yeah in one example. I can think of off the top of my head is an elderly person that Is transported via mental illness back to a different time And you know you walk in the room and they say hey and they say call you by a different name Um, have you ever dealt with that? Yeah, and so you get it and so your options are okay. Well, they think we're living in 1982 right now I can burst the bubble right now and then have all this despair and pain and anguish and stress And then when they lapse back into this 10 minutes from now, I can burst the bubble again or I can just live with this at peace And that is technically a lie To be like, oh, I'm doing great. You know, even though you just called me, you know your brother's name or whatever But every time you burst that bubble you're making them relive all the memories of both the trump and biden presidencies All over again. You monster. Just let it slide. You know what I'm trying to say. I do know what you're trying Yeah, so it's it's and I think it's interesting Yeah, so what do you think about this whole thing? I'm dealing with the kids. Uh, obviously I'm assuming this episode will End it. Yeah, I think it will well, I would praise you and your family on a couple of levels Not that that's why you asked me to listen in number one It's just clear you guys really like each other and you have an awesome thing going as a family fun That's that's part of the reason family's awesome is you just you get these things that happen these little How do you even script it just it's just? Organically spontaneously happens as a product of being in such close proximity And over such a long period of time and seeing each other grow and change It's just irreplaceable. It's so special and precious and this is an example of you leaning into it. This is beautiful and awesome second Respectfully, I would suggest you are asking the wrong question when it comes to is it true or is it not? I want to throw this out. It's bold. Okay, and you don't have to accept it, but maybe think about it I think integrity might be the word you're looking for. Okay And if the question is is this being handled with truth? No Like even technical truth with you withholding it You it's a technicality, but if the question is Integrity, I think everybody's handling the thing with integrity like they're not they're not harming their kid's sister She's a part of it Yes, they are obviously making up Lies of no harm and they would stop immediately if it was hurting her And you by what you have participated in and withheld and the clever ways you've wiggled between the solemn posts of this particular little myth that has been created It's been technically true, but more so it's it's been filled with integrity And so there's this whole aspect of life that we get to enjoy If we allow a little bit of give and take with each other on Telling white lies fibs goofing stick together, but never violating integrity And I think you've all honored the principle of integrity While having fun with the story because all stories involve make believe and goofing in this way I think you're all handling it beautifully and I think it's really cool and I think integrity is what you value and truth is a component of that It's really fun. I've okay. We've had a lot of fun with it. Booyah All right Legend of herald will be force samlin. I think we kind of killed him here. Didn't we? He's done. Yeah, he's dead.
