What's that? Well, it's kind of a big deal. Tara's like, hey, I gotta bake some cookies tonight. I'm like, okay I got a big cookies. She's not something she says. Oh, it's the thing and What do you think is? The cookie swap with all the moms there's like a bunch of moms that get together and Tara's in there cooking the seven layer bars that I love oh so much and She cooks I think it's eight dozen cookies, which is a ton and then she goes to this lady's house and they They have this little get together and then they swap the cookies and then Tara comes back With just all the cookies you could imagine you know imagine like the biggest donut box you can imagine Okay, I'm doing that now. Yeah, you know, but you can still carry it and Oh, okay, so let's be reasonable. Yeah, reasonable and then fill it with cookies and Everyone so like you get like three cookies of each ladies favorite So I've got two cookies now that I'm wait wait wait wait go ahead I'm gonna throw out some types of cookies. Yes that I don't know what they're called But I can just describe them from having seen them and you tell me if you have them, okay? Yeah, I don't have I don't have the whole box in front of me. I'm just gonna have to go for memory here Okay, I'm picturing a cookie that is about two and a half inches across and It's a darker brown. It's just kind of a glob and then jammed right in the middle of it is A Hershey's kiss. Do you have that kind of cookie? Oh? I know the one you're talking about No, no, I what I'm gonna say you're not gonna believe that's probably too simple for this cookie swap Yeah, that's well. It is the south. That's like the amateur hour cookie Wow, okay I'm sitting here. I got two cookies didn't know what they were gonna taste like before I got them one of them looks like your basic Sugar cookie, but it also looks like a peanut butter cookie But when you bite into it, it's lemon and there's almond crumble on top. What I know, right? I am but a practical man of the West We don't do things like that here. Oh dude. Avoid being slaughtered by bears Dude primarily some time for that kind of stuff. I am now Oh dude, we're like four days away from the cookie swap and I've been saving this one that I just took a bite of It's a four days out from it or four days away from when it occurs. No, no, we're like It happened four days ago Okay, so it's like the equivalent of November 3rd to Halloween Yeah, basically and so got it Such a dumb way of saying it was so funny, but also very clear. Thank you So I've been waiting on this deep dark chocolate looking cookie And it's got like what I thought were white chocolate Things and it's not it tastes like an Andy's meant bar But it's but it's me like chewy like a child dude. It is so amazing. It's one of my favorite things about Christmas time Anyway, Tariq it great. She made the what we call the seven layer bars And we're not allowed to have a full Like a full tray of these at our house because I will just sit there and eat them with milk They're like got some coconut got some I don't know toffee It's amazing. You guys don't know this is sophisticated. Yeah, you don't do that in the West I don't know probably people do I just When I can't relate to cool things that you do I like to just make it sound like it's because of how tough and gritty we are out here But the reality is I might just not do cool things all the time Sometimes I'm just boring No, people make cool cookies out here. I mean you got to change how you do it because of the altitude Maybe that's it. Let's go with that. Let's blame it on the altitude But that's one of the things I love about the south is like dude when I was getting married There's this guy You know how there's a person that You can tell that the old man wisdom is just about to hit you right square in the between the eyes He says hey man Let me talk to you about the you you got engaged right I said yes, sir Is my old baseball coach? He goes well, let me tell you something and you uh, you write this down if you need to I said, okay, what is it? He goes Love and don't last but cook and do And I said Uh, mr. Phillips. What what does that mean? He goes well, it's like this It's like eventually all this sweet love and you got right now He's like that's gonna change and I guess what I would the way I would describe that is You know you go from this Mostly aros type love and you in you move out You know you're physically attracted to each other and it transforms into something more like storgy and agape That's what that's a nice way of saying it. But the way he said it is love and don't last but cook and do meaning She uh if she can cook she'll always be able to cook So that's what that's what he told me and so in the south. I think it's a really big deal for the younger ladies and the older ladies to kind of work together on that And uh, yeah, I got some buddies that can cook they cook really good. I I don't know what what are we talking about today? I'm sorry. I'm just telling you about cookies This is great. No, I find myself very intrigued by it and I'm jealous, but man that I think the cookies you're describing are too sophisticated for me the Christmas cookie I like the most and then I find myself wanting right now is your standard issue stocking shaped sugar cookie Yeah, with just exactly the right amount of frosting on the top And a nice little crisp like just a golden brown Crisp around the edges and I want the full soggy sugar cookie You bite into it. It's crispy, but you get right to the very middle and there's just a little bit Of tenderness to it right there You me tell you who is a cookie savant like somebody that really cares Bob claggitt's wife Amazing Really? Yes, dude. It is not a joke her and I we see out of high on the importance of cookies She can make a mean chocolate chip cookie. It's great. We were uh, they make things in that family They do he likes to make stuff. So we were in a uh, we went to visit them one time and um, they were they were remodeling the kitchen and She didn't have her full oven And so she had this little air fryer kind of thing and she made these cookies and i'm just gonna level with you, dude I was like I think she burnt these cookies So we're at their house You know, she she sees that sometimes I I Make little instagram stories about eating chocolate chip cookies at night and she's like i'm gonna make you some cookies She did and I look at them in the oven. I'm like, oh man. She burned them. What do I do? I can't I can't tell her she burnt the cookies. I gotta eat this cookie and pretend like I like it And then the weirdest thing. Thank you. Could I have another? Yeah, yeah, that's that's my that's my role. I took a bite of the cookie and it was amazing She had to overcompensate because of her cooking device So that she she was just like, you know what? We're just gonna forget about how it looks We're going directly for taste and she made an amazing cookie with a subpar cooking setup. I was very impressed It was fantastic really chewy on the inside. It looked like it was burnt, but it wasn't Still haven't figured that out, but it was it was fantastic. Anyway, missus clagget. You make a mean cookie Mean is good. You make a great cookie. I guess I need to make sure there's no ambiguity there I really like what you're describing though in terms of like that's uh That's one of those stand on the shoulders of giants who came before you kind of thing If everybody had to learn everything about how to make something And beautiful in a culinary sense from scratch I mean in the the literal in the figurative sense from from nothing if you had to start from zero every generation That would be horrible. Dude. That's really one of the things that connects us across generations It's one of the things that Outlives us recipe wise have you seen that holiday coca-cola commercial they're running right now With the dude who's trying to bake the pie No, I like making pie. Dude. I don't like commercials. You're good at making pies by the way. Thanks Yeah, you want to talk about somebody who's got a nice touch you got a nice touch you make artful pies destined sand Thank you. They're all cherry pies and I just scoop stuff out of a can into it. It's just Is there another kind of pie Come on It's just a coca-cola and it's just this guy and he's clearly trying to make a pie and it's clearly not his strong suit But his mom is there walking him through it looking over his shoulder and nodding and everything else He gets the pie out right as holiday company gets there. It doesn't look perfect But it's in earnest And he gets an approving look from his mom Oh right before he goes in to greet the company But then the camera pulls back And you realize that mom was only in the reflection of the mirror and that she's gone and she's memorialized above I'm gonna tear up man. Stop it Really I didn't see that coming. I was like, oh, yeah, mom's gonna read stream Whoa, yeah But wow, that made me feel the thing just some of the little points of connection with the people we love who came before It's sneaky like that. And so at first I was like, oh, cookies are good That's just one more thing to busy yourself with during an already frantic time of year And then you talked about that connection the younger ladies the older ladies and what your wise old sage baseball coach told you and I was like, huh Now there's something to that and I much better appreciate that people take the time and energy to pass along these traditions to pass along These flavors so many things that we pass along to each other come in the forms of things you hear or see That's something that you smell and taste that you actually physically internalize that is a gift from someone else That's pretty special. It is she's in a group call they call themselves the tie this two group It's interesting because they strategically make these groups Where you'll have some older ladies in there with some like You know just from every generation 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s And they'll arrange it so that they have people from every generation in there And so when Tara started being in the group it was a really big deal because You have people that are just a little further down the road than you are right there I thought it was impressive. I thought it was really cool This episode of note on questions is brought to you by hello fresh destined. Is there somebody there? Yeah, I have a special Uh a special guest with me here This is my oldest son. How you doing buddy? I'm doing good. Yeah, so you're gonna get right up on the mic a little and i'll say it again How are you doing? I'm doing good. Can you hear yourself in the microphone? Yes, sir. Is this your first time speaking on a microphone like this kind of okay Yeah, how you doing buddy? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm very good. I have a sneaking suspicion I understand what your dad is doing here, man. I'm Guessing that he's roping you in to talk about making hello fresh with him. Am I anticipating correctly? Probably well to be clear You said you were okay talking with this about me. It's actually different than that matt my son Actually is I would say you're the champion of hello fresh at our house. Would you agree? Yes, sir. So would you just explain to matt like what it is and What like you don't listen to them questions, right? I'll listen to when i'm in the car with you what i'm doing the preview listens. Yeah, you do when you're forced No, that's true. So tell matt what your relationship with hello fresh is because I haven't told him a lot about what we do so weekly Hello fresh will send a box and it'll have three different meals And then it will send you the ingredients inside of a bag along with the meat and it will tell you what you need outside of the box And then it will give you simple instructions to make the item Which the other day we ended up making like pork katsu or something like that Yeah pork katsu which is something i've never heard of i've never heard No, me neither. I've heard of the pork part. Yeah, so he actually cooks this All the time so it's it's not uncommon for me to be like, oh man. We got it We need to eat real quick and then you'll just go get it out of the fridge and you'll just whip it up, right? You see what's your uh favorite thing you cook so far? Well, I think it was last week we cook burgers with old bay seasoning And it's really good. You liked it. It was amazing. Yeah, it's awesome. So he's doing a really good job with it, dude So yeah, very pro. Okay. I have an emotional question for you. All right How does it feel cooking for your family? Does that conjure an emotion for you or is it just the thing you do? I find it really fun and I like cutting up the stuff. That's my favorite part of it. Why do you like that? I don't know. You do. Yeah, yeah, do you feel like it's made you better at cooking in general? Yeah, like do you think you're learning stuff and improving? Yes, sir. It would have been weird if you'd said no No, he's doing good. What is our uh, I mean, obviously it's good. Do you think it's good for our family? Yes, sir. Yeah, why do you think it's good for our family? P.s. We're not stuck eating hamburger helper all the time You what's okay? All right. I'm just going to allow it because you know we're recording. You know how I feel. All right So the joke is uh the other night I did my best to try to Feed us for the minimum amount of money possible and so I went to the grocery store and the best I could do was hamburger helper. I've already told you this I think man But it was uh, yeah, you have yeah, it was interesting. It was a noble effort It was a noble effort, but you do prefer hello fresh. I do prefer hello fresh. Yeah, absolutely Yeah, maybe just let the kid handle the food from here and I'll do that Real quick.

Would you say yes, sir? I think right now. We all like trout or something. Do we yeah? Whoa, is it trout or salmon? Do you know I think it's trout. Okay, awesome. I mean they're kind of related. Yeah, yeah, they're both fish It's healthy too. It feels better when we eat hello fresh Then a lot of the quick garbagey food that we'll just get on the run And time-wise really by the time we run out and get quick garbagey food that we know is bad for us We could have just made a hello fresh and be feeling great afterwards and we have learned that lesson over time That it's just the better option.

Thanks for being on over this buddy Thank you Hard pivot from holiday cookie conversation, which was far more intriguing and appetizing than I had anticipated Thank you for that. I'm going to go make a cookie Type thing happen in my life now this holiday season i'm inspired But question and I guess this is a hard pivot brother. How hard are we talking mechanism cleared? Yeah, it's hard this a lot like let's go from that to like existential thought about the nature of your existence All right, let's go all right. I guess all existential thought it's about the nature of your existence It's okay in the name, but whatever How do you conceive of your life? What is the the mental image that you have of the unfolding of your life? A circle Okay, and the way it works is there's this circle and I've got the stuff I don't know. I think of it two ways. I think of it as like a wheel touching a road. I also but I kind of think of it I think of the top of the wheel almost so The things that i've already rolled by That's like the past and the things that are coming up is the future and in the moment where it touches the now is the now And so the only moment where I truly exist Is right in the moment where it touches? eternity Does that makes is that what you're asking? How many people in the third chair right now do you think we're taking their pointer finger And making a wheel gesture and picturing how wheels hit the road And which rotation moves the vehicle in which way The following were describing well, I was no I mean the tangent point Is the point at which um I don't know. I I think of time as this medium through which I travel okay, and There's only this one moment where I exist And that's the now and then there's a stuff that's meat that's already passed and the stuff that's coming up in the future Is is this what you're asking? Wow interesting Yeah, it goes deeper so it's just what you said is very very different from how I would answer The question well, here's this other there's this other thing to it like I think about people in my past like my grandfather my dad and my my dad's in my now But like well, let's talk about my dad for example. Okay my dad It's almost like his circle or his wheel has rotated a different total angle than mine but we We exist right now like His now and mine now both exist but his wheel has rotated farther than mine And so I think of this life experience that that a person has as You know the the unraveling of their life And for example my grandfather or my great great great grandfather that I never met If I were to somehow be able to recalibrate those wheels and roll them back And I were to be like, okay there right there is 41 years. That's where destined is right now Let's take his great great grandfather's wheel and bring it up here And you can rotate it to where it says 41 years for him And line them up in the now. I would love to have that conversation just me And him the person I don't even know his name if we were to sit down and have a conversation his 41 year old men That'd be awesome. Yes, for example, my son. I love him dearly. I've got two sons But you know just pick my oldest one because he's going through their most change in his life right now I love him dearly and The only thing that separates his life experience in mine. There's a lot, but the only thing Really is that I'm just a little further down the road than he is But I respect him just the same Like I would love to be his friend Um right now i'm his parent and that's not the same thing Yeah, but i'm imagining a time where when he's got you know more of his life is enrolled and more of my life is enrolled We can speak more like peers because we both get more Road behind us and you know that those differences in age don't matter quite as much Hmm. I don't know if this makes any sense. How do you I was even the question. How do you visualize the unraveling of your life Matt Is that what sounded when I asked no it's not I was it just sounded like you were pontificating and I was trying to figure out how you said it Because it was really silly Silky like like with a lounge singer in the background and like you were wearing a smoking jacket I liked it. I was imagining the caterpillar from allis and wonderlands what I was imagining. Uh, okay, uh Speaking of which I'm in a smoking jacket. I think when my life unravels more I'm starting to consider like in the far distant future. I can imagine myself smoking a tobacco pipe I can imagine do you mean unravels or unfolds? Because unfolds means that stuff went well and you had good health and more time passed when I hear unravels I more think like Everything went south and heavy drinking Forgive me. I'm not using the correct word. I mean unroll Like unroll not unravel unroll Okay, that's good. Yeah, so like I'm imagining this Progress this enrolling of my life a long time So if things go well, you may one day smoke a pipe If things go poorly You're probably not going to smoke a pipe. Yeah, there you go. There you go. Okay. Cool. Yep I think i'm i think i'm tracking with all of that now. You asked how I conceive of it I thought you were going to give the same answer. I'm about to so your answer surprised me But it shouldn't that you would use an analogy from a mechanism something that can be engineered for efficiency and predictability and also artistry and elegance I of course you would latch on to an image like that. Of course, that's how you'd visualize it. It makes perfect sense And of course, I would visualize mine as a narrative a story where I play a character and other people's stories and then they contribute as characters in my story as well and It's not one singular narrative. There are a lot of different stories that I might latch on to for a season of time or You know imagine some kind of tragedy if i'm real down or some kind of triumphant hero story for a minute if I Indulge my pride after something goes right but for the most part I just think of it with the basic beats of A typical story You start off and there's all kinds of adventure and potential in front of you But you know really know what you're doing and then there's some sort of call to adventure And in my case like most people's cases. It's just you get a little older and then you have to go do things at some point And then you meet other characters along the way and the friction between the motivation of you and the other people you meet positive negative in between that fuels a lot of the action that makes things go and the action isn't always Marvel style action where you've got direct overt Eye-popping on-screen stuff happening most of the action is in the life of the mind and the shared life of the mind and the soul with the other characters but Definitely there's a beginning and a middle and an end and as a result there's a little bit of grief baked in to the divides between the acts and To where you're at percentage wise as you imagine the unfolding of the story Maybe it's a little slavish. Maybe that's what Don Henley meant when he said we've been poisoned by these fairy tales that Some maybe our stories write back on us too much but certainly stories have written back on me and how I think about things but Maybe humanity has always been writing stories and so Our shared experience created stories and then stories and form back on us what the reality of the human experience is from the dawn of time but yeah for me there is no mechanism for me it is overwhelmingly Some kind of narrative flow does that surprise you? No I'm trying to decide now if that means that the way I visualize it is more self-centered because I'm only thinking about my wheel Or my circle so to speak like you didn't say you were the hub No, I I don't know. I'm just trying to think about it. So you think about yourself in relation to others I'm just thinking like my life going along like a fuse burning like I've got an x amount of life and You know x minus t Is how much I got left? So another mechanical example You know what I mean? I'm just uh, I guess I do and it's a good analogy Yeah I guess that's kind of how I think about it interesting Hmm. What is the thing that you and Amy were talking about that time? You said something about there's a story arc and you you said there's a hero's story arc. I forget what you called it Yeah, joseph Campbell Is a mid 20th century? I What do you call it a narrow A-logist I mean he was a dude who thought about psychology and storytelling and literature the heroes journey I think his that was it. Yeah, I think his most famous work is the hero of a thousand faces It's something like that I mean it's a pretty famous book that lots of people continue to buy and read it really informed george lucas When he was crafting the first star wars film and that whole universe I think his idea is that he went and looked at a whole bunch of myths from all around the world religious storytelling fairy tales All the stories people tell him what he found Was that there were some very common elements that seem nearly inescapable And he postulates that these elements are always there because they are reflective of humanity and how we Reckon time and aging and relationships and intersecting with other people on this time continuum and so The journey of these stories then it looks like you're going through places and challenges and Going to chase after the mcguffin or whatever But really all of these things are a metaphor for the search for self the search for meaning Knowledge of self to know and be known all of that kind of stuff And because people are wired the same way he theorized or fairly the same way These same elements keep cropping up in stories all over the world for millennia And those elements include certain types of characters who crop up but also certain motifs of storytelling and so when you talk about Campbell's narrative theory you're talking about character archetypes and just story structure archetypes and not Everything fits neatly into that But most of the stuff that feels right going down when you watch it probably fits into that somehow What hero archetype are you the hero of your story? I guess is what i'm trying to say Hero and main character Don't mean the same thing If you if you're talking about different sets of archetypes so Aristotle had a list of archetypes that he thought were present in story including as well as a couple other even older famous or greek philosophers and fiction writers before him Campbell is a distillation of Aristotle and manander And a whole bunch of stuff that happened in between including like arthurian legends and all of that But that's not the only one carl yung the he's Swiss right the 20th century. I don't know psychologist like the associate of sigmund Freud Uh, I think he swiss. I don't know don't quote me on that one but He did a whole bunch of work on a whole bunch of different things and I think yung's big thing was the idea of um Is actualization isn't the right word but it's It's this awareness of self this getting to a point where you understand self and you become connected with A lot of the human archetypes that that make us what we are. What was his term? Individual, that's the term His psychology focused on what he called? Individualization and so storytelling he believed was a big part of this And so the yungian archetypes they're a little different list than the Gamblight archetypes kambalite. That's a like a religious movement. I don't know it's Campbell's archetypes. They're different and uh Maybe not as universally observable in film and literature as Campbell's archetypes But maybe more observable in the people you meet in everyday life So kambal says there are about eight archetypes in stories yung I think has 12 And there's a lot of overlap between the two so if we're talking about the yungian archetype structure Hero is just one of the 12 And i'm just gonna i'm gonna reel them off because it's pretty interesting here. Hang on a second Okay, I got this. Yeah, yeah, you just said a lot and it's very difficult for me to keep up But sorry. Yeah, that's a lot, you know, I'm sorry for all of that The gist right is that there are common threads to storytelling Yeah, and that different quality thinkers have tried to make sense of that either through a psychological lens or through a literary analysis lens or Through both. Okay Okay, here we go uh, the yungian archetypes are the innocent the orphan the hero the caregiver the seducer the rebel the lover the creator the joker the mentor the magician and the ruler Okay I'm i'm looking this up now. There's an image Jungian archetypes j-u-n-g-i-a-n Okay All right, this is yeah, did you did you come across his wheel of archetypes? I'm looking for it. It's it's like a I'm seeing it on images here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling me what you're seeing describe that to me when you pull it up It looks like a color wheel um, okay, and it says in the It's divided into quadrants and it's also divided into Each quadrant is divided into three groups so Um, I don't know if this is is this his wheel like he came up with it Uh, I think that's an extrapolation, but I think it's faithful It's very hard to explain what i'm looking at with an audio only medium here So to show these 12 things on one graph. There's four quadrants top right the spiritual journey the bottom right leave a mark Bottom left connect to others top left provide structure and each of those four categories the Jungian structure of thought about character archetypes Each of those four categories has three archetypes where that's what they're trying to achieve. So leave a mark Well, which of those archetypes would be most interested in leaving a mark the innocent the orphan the seduce the hero Clearly the hero would have to be on that in that quadrant, right? Yeah Who else do you see there the magician and the outlaw? Okay Yeah, sometimes you'll hear the the outlaw called the rebel or the rogue Yeah in in terms of film and storytelling You know that archetype right the rebel the rogue. Yeah, absolutely. Give me some examples who comes to mind Han Solo Yeah, yeah, the Psh the rebel the road mad martigan Wolverine Yeah, yeah, Wolverine. I mean the rebel or the rogue that's it's the hero with the heart of gold Okay. Yeah, I had a buddy who says deadpool fits into that category Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, interesting. So you can just let's just pick a random character. So let's say Oh, I don't know inspector gadget so I don't know that's about okay not the seducer Probably not the seduce probably not the seducer. Okay. All right. All right. He's the hero. That's where he is. He's the hero Yeah Maybe maybe he's the joker A little bit. Yeah I miss inspector gadget. I think they go watch some of the old cartoon. Yeah, I did too. That was good stuff. I needed to do that Okay, so what are you? I think I would be For me, I feel like the every man. That's what I feel like It's what okay. That's what I want to be. What is what does the every man want? Uh The qua it's in the connect with others Uh, connect to others quadrant. Yes. Yes Yeah, it's where pate and manning said that he wanted to be he wanted to be known as a good teammate When asked at the end of his career How he wanted to be remembered with all of his achievements and everything else. I want to be a good teammate. That's a good answer Yep. Yep. That's a really good answer. What about you? Where are you at? Well Respectfully, I'm not sure how that's how it works. I think it depends on the question in relation to who Like who am I in relation to Camilla? Um the lover Yes I selflessness passion Self sacrifice could be the magician driving motivation is to know and be known right? No, the magician. I think you'd be the magician in relation. Yeah, I could see that too. Have you mentioned it? But Who am I to my kids or a couple people who I know from? You know, maybe work or something like that or the the kids I coach. Well, I think I'm the mentor Like there even though I don't I'm I'm no obi one canobi. I'm playing that role I'm the white bearded Calm steadying character in their life, but I don't conceive of myself as the mentor in my own story But in the story of others, I think that's the role I play for better or worse. Maybe the disappointing mentor But certainly that in other environments Wow, I feel resonance with the rebel the rogue Yeah, that's I think rules are a little bit overrated I am definitely on the chaotic good quadrant and I super resonate with the people who are like Yeah, I don't have time for the uh The stupid rules and all of this. I want to do good. I'm gonna go try to do good And when I screw up well, we'll dig out of it when we dig out of it I I might not be good at it But I feel resonance with that kind of character Do you feel resonance with the rogue or is that foreign to you? Oh Not really no, I don't I'm kind of a rule follower more than me I guess that's probably true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is true. Actually, it's true. Yeah, it's true Yeah, but the thing is also I play the role of the innocent Depending on who I'm interacting with At there are times and I'm like, you know what? I'm not doing shrewd rogue rebel win with force thing here I just want to try to do what's right and what's good and one of the weaknesses of the innocent is naivete vulnerability Losing at things you should maybe win at but I play that role and none of these are an act that just Life and circumstances and relationships give us the opportunity to play a lot of different parts In different stories. I mean, it just it just depends on how you frame the story or what little bit of the passage of time You clip out and who you point the spotlight at most dramatically I mean the same one week can give you a jillion different stories Just all unfolding at once and you're in a lot of those stories But you do not play the same role in those stories. Let's play a game here real quick So I yep, if I'm sitting in the third chair right now I'm probably pretty confused because you said a lot of stuff and it's hard to Imagine ourselves in relation to other people. So here's what I'd like to do I'd like to let's identify a person and we're gonna as a thought experiment We're gonna say who am I in relation to that person and then I'll read off the archetypes and then we can think about who it is So who are we gonna start with? About our boss everybody has a boss. I mean, okay great. Love it Even if you work on your own like if you own the business You kind of have a boss because somebody you're trying to make somebody happy in order to make money. Okay to your boss Which of these are you um the ruler The creator slash artist the sage the innocent explorer rebel hero wizard Or magician the jester every man lover caregiver Hmm. So what would be your answer there? not the seducer again, yep Creator sounds right just given my job description But I don't think it's that Wow, I don't know that's very difficult man. It is. I have multiple bosses. That's a tough relationship Yeah, I don't know how do you answer that Yeah, um, I think I think we should all say not the seducer to start all the time because it's funny It depends on what your job is So I would say um For the youtube thing I would like to say creator artist um The youtube thing I would like to answer there for the the thing where I do aerospace engineering I would say Uh in in that capacity, I've I've learned a lot of things So the word this one has a sage It's a weird word, but I would like to say in that capacity Because I'm typically working with younger people and I'm helping them see things that I learned the hard way there we go Yeah, yeah, so I would say in that capacity. I kind of served that role and the other boss I have would be with school And with school I don't know that's a hard one. I'd probably say the explorer maybe Like i'm trying to figure things out. I mean in some cases they probably think i'm the rebel Because i'm not a full-time student Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm not a full-time student. I may uh, I think there might be something to that part-time student, right? Yeah, what about you your bosses? That's tricky back when I used to work at a church um What an odd employment arrangement that line of work is it's um Yeah, because you have to be the care to nail down the caregiver Um once I'm very much so Yeah, that is that is strange Yeah, I mean the the orphan in a way Which one is the orphan because I'm getting harry potters the orphan Frodo's the orphan Uh, well heck Luke's guy walker is that the innocence? Because there are multiple lists and I'm finding that these names aren't settled on Sure. I think the innocent is different from the orphan I think the orphan is always trying to overcome always has a little bit of imposter syndrome once acceptance But they're an orphan they don't they don't have a family And I think sometimes part of the relationship between a pastor and a church when I used to do that Involves that you're a part of the family of faith, but you're the only one getting paid And you're the one who has to have the hard conversations when things get sideways or weird Um, so there's a survival instinct that kicks in that's one of the characteristics of the orphan Empathy but also scrappiness Uh, I think if you're pastoring wrong you think of yourself as the hero in that job It's just all the talent To overcome everything, but I think you're more on to something when you say the the caregiver The weakness of the caregiver is that they can be taken advantage of The strength of the caregiver is they don't care If you get hurt looking out for other people or showing care, that's so strange She just said the the sentence you just assembled is the strength of the caregiver is that they don't care That that's just an odd sentence, but what you're saying But what you're saying is they don't care that they're taking advantage of that's what you mean I just I just thought it was an interesting sentence to say but right they they would die a thousand deaths if they stopped showing care to other people And the only way to prevent being taken advantage of or getting dinged up by the occasional bad actor is to Fully insulate yourself and not care about anybody. I mean you can't pass her like that This episode of note-um questions is brought to you by audible It's open on my phone constantly. I cannot get enough.

It's so weird and I already have this yeah go to the plus catalog and check it out I think you'll love it Okay, so so the the Jungian archetypes is what you call it. Is that right? Uh-huh Jungian Jungian? So Is the whole premise here? I don't understand really what it is But is the premise here that you kind of play these different roles at different points in your life I mean obviously in storytelling these are used to progress stories, but Is that kind of what you're you're getting at here because yeah and we're in your and for your world here for Jung I think it's psychology first storytelling as Second as a touchpoint the individuation Is the target objective? It's a way that you identify yourself as being your own thing That's what he seemed to care about whereas camels Archetypes I think are much simpler much more rooted in the historical stories There are eight and they're more orienting because it's psychology second story first For Campbell you just got the hero, but hero is synonymous with protagonist The hero is going to have all kinds of flaws But the hero is the character who is the the main driving force that moves the action of the story Forward, but the hero can only go so far alone. So the hero is going to need a mentor This would be the yungi in sage or mentor character The hero can't accomplish all these things on their own So with the exception of like john wick You just never see hero stories that follow the hero's journey where there's not help and even john wick has allies in a you know an Isolated hero rogue kind of story like that. So you always got the allies You've always got your sam gamji and those allies are always named sam Sam and game of thrones sam and lord of the rings. It's just a it's a warm name Then in the kambalite narrative structure the narrative archetypes you've got the herald This is the character who shows up might be a good guy might be a bad guy But they appear and they introduce the character To the journey ahead they bring tidings they bring news Of what is going to shake the hero out of their static existence Then along the way you meet the fifth archetype who is the trickster the trickster isn't necessarily a bad guy They spice things up. They make it fun. They subvert And they allow the journey to go to places that aren't scripted and predictable Marion pippin play this role in lord of the rings Along the way you will usually meet a shape shifter the shape shifter is the one whose allegiances are vague and confusing Maybe they are some kind of neutral alignment. Maybe they are a double agent but In so many of these stories if you really think hard about it, even if that one seems obscure What comes to mind is yeah, this this person exists the guardian or the threshold guardian as i was taught to refer to this character Is hymdall in Thor? This is the one who stands in the way of where the hero wants to go and represents a checkpoint Usually there's a quiz or a test or a challenge that has to be overcome To move past the threshold guardian and once that's achieved There is growth and then finally the shadow the shadow is the dark side of who the main character is the evil or secretive expression and so a lot of times in the hero's journey the bad guy Isn't totally a bad guy under themselves The bad guy is a bad guy In contrast in relation to the characteristics of the protagonist or the hero Which is why so often you get that you and i We're not so different. We should work together. What if we combined our That yungi in psychology says yeah do that find your shadow understand it incorporate it That's part of your process the more historic mythic storytelling says Maybe familiarize yourself with your shadow but confront it And the shadow is something that has to be dealt with but I think in the kambalite understanding. It's a little bit more worrisome than in the yungi in understanding So is that a simpler list? I mean, I think it is. Does it strike you as a simpler list? I don't know. No, this is very complicated to me It's this fair enough. I want to play along. I want to play along be like oh, yeah, this makes so much sense it's very complicated and uh I'm sorry, but uh I know stories your thing, but you know all of this when you watch a show Somebody comes on screen and you're like, don't trust them How do you know? Well, I can spot the seducer Well, yeah, I mean there are there are things that stick out there for sure Yes, so there's that and then I can spot the magician normally Um, everything else the character has to develop and so you have to like figure out slowly over time Oh, okay. This is you know, but I don't instantly do is this how you watch movies? You watch a movie and you're like, oh, that's this person. That's this archetype. Is that a thing for you? sometimes I more than anything. I just feel it. There's a rhythm to a story That can be really beneficial in life, but also you can inflict the rigid structure of story Onto life and to miss assess people if you're not careful Whereas in film or reading a book there's very little consequence to be unlike ah, there we go That's the ally. That's the one who's going to ride all the way down with our hero And then later you realize dang it. That was a shapeshifter Well, who cares like it just made the story more interesting and Subverted some expectations, but in life Wow, you miss on something like that or even limit someone to being just one thing you can really pigeonhole them and Resultingly mistreat them think about them wrongly You know, it's it's not as simple look if you go back through your life and you think about the eight categories That Campbell provides and you just assume yourself to be the protagonist of a story that follows your journey You can probably fill in one two three four five characters For each of these archetypes the shadow the guardian the shapeshifter the trickster the herald the ally the mentor even the shadow I bet there are a couple of names that you could conjure of A dark version of yourself Attributes like yours, but not wielded in the way you intend to wield them But yet you have to grapple with that and wrestle with it And try to figure out what to do with the existence of this other Approach to life or ethics or whatever. I'm guessing you could fill in all the archetypes with people from your journey through life Yeah, absolutely. What am I? Absolutely What are you? Am I the shapeshifter? Oh? Yeah, you are the shapeshifter. You're not the seducer you continue to not be the seducer. I've been working out I'm drinking a lot of milk and I'm working out every single day What is the official list? What do I? Jungian Archetypes, well, we're on we're on Campbell's archetypes Campbell's archetypes. Yeah, it goes with camel problem Campbell archetype simpler list. Yeah, it's a simpler list. Okay. Got it now It took me a while to pull this thing up and all of these are predicated on the hero and his allies Having to overcome something change grow evolve through the influence of the mentor through the challenges presented by the threshold guardian and usually the downfall of the shadow the villain and the villain or shadows agents. There's always a henchman the bad guy always has to have help too Their downfall is that they don't grow and change They're too certain of who they are and what they are and oftentimes their ability to grow and learn and adapt has become calcified and it's the the suppleness the flexibility the responsiveness to Teaching and growth and good outside influence and discernment That causes the hero and the hero's allies to gain what they need to defeat this evil I don't know man. I think I almost feel like this is an effort to neatly organize Something that's extremely con complex. It's like a continuum Um, and it's not discreet that that's a better way of saying it This is an effort to discretize is that a word? Discret? I don't know turn a continuous continuous Thing into discrete elements. That's what it feels like okay because at times you're you're the jester, right? It times you're the rebel. Yes At times you're the caregiver when I just want to you know I want somebody to hear me out you're the caregiver, you know at times you're the sage when I ask you questions Um, the only thing Well, there's there's a lot of things on here, but I don't know I I'm not gonna say I reject this because this is Humanities this is stuff you understand better than I do but it seems like an overly complicated way to try to Make categories that aren't as clean as This chart would have me believe I think that's a very fair statement. Am I allowed to reject your thing? Ah, thank you. Seriously. You're just asking now Yeah as evidence for my okayness with that. I would submit the last decade Yeah, okay, you're allowed to reject my thing, but let me just offer A little different set of categories and see if that reframes it for you Okay When people read the bible the book of matthew and they read jesus parable about the sower And the seeds It's in matthew 13. You know the one, but I'll remind you and for the benefit of the third chair The the disciples are starting to wonder they just started following jesus. He seems really impressive It looks like he can break the laws of time and space he teaches with authority. They're very interested in him But still it's not exactly clear who he is or what any of this means. He's talking about some kingdom That transcends kingdoms of the world. So it's I mean it's a big claim And after all these miracles and stuff that he does Only some people are signing up and others aren't and the disciples no doubt were confused But kind of didn't know how to articulate like why if this is the truest thing Why isn't everybody signing up jesus gets in a boat and he tells him a parable and the parable there's a sower Uh like a person who sows seeds and he's got a bag full of seeds. Nothing wrong with the seeds He goes and he throws them on four different types of soil One of which immediately Rejects the seed it's just hard. It's rock. I mean there's just no chance Two other types of soil the seed kind of takes for a little while But then for various reasons it doesn't work out and only on one type of soil does the seed really take And produce a full grown plant that produces its own seeds And yields a harvest 30 60 a hundred times what was originally planted Usually when you hear people talk about that passage and church or any kind of religious setting They'll be like which kind of soil are you? Where do you fit? Are you the rocky soil? Are you the one where there are concerns and troubles and you get choked out by thorns Or are you the good soil? But it doesn't look like that's the the intended meaning that wasn't the pressure that caused jesus to tell the story The pressure that caused them to tell the story was curiosity about How is your whole jesus thing gonna unfold through history? Is everybody just gonna run out and sign up? Will people be against it as soon as somebody hears it? Is it like magic and then they become a jesus follower or does it work different and so the parable I think really does a great job of clarifying that and history seems to vindicate the accuracy of of what jesus was saying there likewise When we go and look at these character archetypes the most automatic natural way to interpret it is who am I? which one of these is me but the better way to interpret this is to say the robust story of our experience and the human experience has these familiar elements in it and Maybe the categories aren't absolutely complete But the role that any given person plays at any given time in any little micro story Is going to be one of these things or it's just going to be in different background character who doesn't do anything but every engaged individual who is growing and actively involved in any given story of any scale I think Campbell is suggesting is going to kind of fit into one of these categories But that's just for that story and then there's the next story And the story at the cash register might be a different story than the one in the parking lot so what a little bit becomes It's not about do you have these characteristics like are you funny like the joker? No It's about these are the characters Who provide impetus to make a story go forward and stories don't tend to go forward Or the kind of stories that we repeat anyway don't tend to go forward Unless you have all of these character archetypes in them to prompt action that only their archetype can prompt To move the stories that we repeat all the time Forward so it isn't a personality test It isn't even about the attributes of the character It's about their role in relationship to the narrative and how they move it forward In the same way that jesus wasn't saying here my parable of the soils and think about what kind of soil you are I mean that might be a fine exercise He was saying understand this bigger story And how each of these soils is is one part of the bigger story Here, I think to rightly understand character archetypes what we're saying is it's not a personality quiz Each of these character archetypes is a a little fragment a component of what is necessary To move a story worth repeating Forward so it kind of takes some of the pressure off to figure out who you are and where you fit And it gives you a mechanism to better appreciate the elements of powerful timeless storytelling Yeah, one thing I did when I looked at the list is I was like, okay, well, you brought up jesus and I'm like Oh, wow, jesus is all of these things and I was thinking about how jesus is sovereign You know, he's in control But then there was a bit of magician in there and then there's creator explorer And I'm looking at all these things. Oh, wow, jesus was all of these things And then I started thinking about my own life And I was like, okay I'm kind of the sovereign over my children I'm kind of the explorer You know, I like to learn and then I went through it and I was like, oh, I can see how I'm all of these things as well If I understand what you're saying I play These roles in other people's lives if I have any type of meaningful relationship with them I'm not just an NPC Right. Um, you are in some stories. I sometimes you're an NPC You're a background character. Yes, you drove by in the back of a shot Right But It would be good to think about what my role is in other people's lives and try to play that role the best to my ability Is that what you're saying? I do think that if there is a personal application here Beyond just better latching on to the grand story of humanity that we are a part of if there's a specific Yeah, I think that's it You know What role you're playing in whatever given little story is unfolding in front of you right now You know what the weaknesses are of that character what the strengths are And if you want to be a character in the story who does things that are good You try to understand what the good outcome is And how to be the best that that archetype has to offer sure. I think that's great huh, okay, so Tell me a time you've been the magician in somebody's life surprise powers of perception intuition and cleverness I think I play that role when I am solving other people's problems with nothing to gain for myself When I look at somebody else's thing and they've been laboring over it for months or years And i'm like We just got those two things in the wrong order flip them around see what that does and they do it and they're like what? How could that be and it's not because i'm brilliant or smart It's just because I hadn't looked at it and it just needed a fresh set of eyes, but Yeah, I think that kind of strategic observation Applying previous knowledge your experience to that situation spur of the moment Yeah, I think that's what it looks like. What about you? Yeah, I had a conversation with one of my sister's friends one time and then they said man every time I have a conversation with you It's like a shockwave and think about it for weeks And then I was like what not the first time I've heard that about you Well, whatever and so I thought back on the conversations and I was like I did not think a lot about that conversation. We just had the conversation and it just happened to be the thing we were talking about I happened to have some life experience that played into what they were talking about So to that person I felt like a magician, but i'm not so I'm not a magician. I don't imagine myself to be a magician But in that person's life I kind of played that role and it wasn't me It was just what they needed to hear at that moment in time and it just happened to come out of my face hole So Very interesting. So I'll think about this. So read the list one last time So I can think about how i'm playing these roles to different people. Okay, so two lists that we're gonna read This first one is the yungi and archetypes. That's the 12 we've been looking at. The magician is on that list And this is the list that is psychology first narrative second And this is the list that is a little more built to think about The roles you play and where you fit on this list are the innocent the orphan the hero The caregiver the seducer the rebel the lover the creator the joker the mentor the magician the ruler list number two is narrative first Psychology and where you fit into it second. This is Campbell's hero of the thousand faces hero's journey The distinguishing point of these eight on this list is not their characteristics It's the role that each of these plays in moving forward a story you need all these elements Most of the time you need all these elements to make a story worth repeating work One the protagonist or hero to the mentor three the ally Four the herald five the trickster six the shape shifter seven the guardian eight the shadow It's pretty hard for me, man. This is a stretch This thing thinking about this stuff is a is a pretty difficult stretch for me So thank you for stretching me Well going deep into your world does the same thing. I mean we for kind of loud we did an episode this year called what is calculus And I got you and grant sanderson in the room talking about just wildly complex stuff and I know How much my insufficiencies were on display, but at the same time I felt like I learned some things. I felt like I saw a few more patterns coming out of that And I also came away feeling like it's okay if this isn't my area of expertise abstractly And I think the same thing here with story structure to me that the story structure thing It's not like some little side thing to me. This is one of the meta explanations of Like this is central to the human experience. This is a gigantic deal To who we are and the stories we tell are more than just like fun little make believe things It's very significant as we work out life and death and God and love and all of the things that Go into the human experience Really, that's what both you and I are trying to tackle just with differing disciplines and Sometimes I feel a ways out of my depth when I get too close to your stuff And I think it's okay if it takes a couple conversations to wrap your brain around this stuff It's hard dude Where I wanted to end up was the exact distinction we ended up making and you led us straight to it Is this a personality quiz or is this something that holds up a mirror to the human experience?
