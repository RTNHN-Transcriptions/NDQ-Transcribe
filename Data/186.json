It's always more fun. We get to record these things together. I think it is Yeah, I like it and I like the air travel between Rapid City, South Dakota and Huntsville. It's not that bad No, it's not bad at all. I can leave my house. I left one hour before the flight because the airport's real close to my house and Made the flight comfortably with 20 minutes of spare of me entering around at the gate so one hour from my house to in the air and Then from there, it's five hours to you pick me up. Dang. That's not that awesome, dude It's it's ridiculous that we live in a time where that can happen. You know one of the best things about the Rapid City Airport. I Would like to know TSA It's good. It's great because there's nobody there It's an airport that everybody wants to fly into because it's super touristy I mean, it's like the pigeon forge of the western half of the United States very family oriented A lot of people come to Rapid City the black Hills Mount Rushmore crazy horse you've been there. Mm-hmm. And so when you fly There's just no line. I have the TSA pre-check, but it doesn't matter at all. There's no line for either ever I've never waited to have my ID scanned really is wavy through. I mean they check the ID that they're responsible But you don't have to wait and with the TSA pre-check I get to go to the Don't have to take my shoes off side and everything scan right through have never been stopped there In all my flying until I came to see you this time around Why are you laughing? I've just imagined you getting a prostate exam. I gotta stopped. Yeah, I got stopped They flagged my bag. I have a bag with nothing in it. I mean this microphone. I'm talking into I brought that yeah and pair headphones a Couple changes of clothes cuz I can do laundry here at the house and Toiletries, that's it. Okay charge it for my phone. It's literally everything I brought. It's impressive. Mm-hmm. Thanks. I appreciate that and My bag gets flagged for that. Okay. Come on. They don't want a microphone and headphones look like what's the problems? The guys like I gotta pull you aside. Come on over here. Stand at this table. Like dang. I'm at the in trouble table What is going on? And he won't touch my bag his hands are like hovering over the bag. Yeah, they can't is that a rule? Usually they say is there anything sharp in the bag that could injure me. Okay, he did ask that. Yep. Yep I said no, no, it's certainly not but he still wasn't touching the bag. I could tell I mean it's a Probably dude in his 50s a little bit of facial hair glasses Bald on top at the long hair a little bit, you know, that's what he looked like in consequence I guess he's just standing there kind of hesitating like this is a really odd check I'd like to get in there like he knew something was in the bag and he was scared of it. I mean he got flagged He's supposed to look through it. It's like he was trying to find words. He's like, okay Well, here's the thing our scans picked up something long in the bag that is vibrating and We prefer to have you turn that off What what are you? Talking about Is like can I open the bag? Yeah, of course. I'm here the TSA agent go for it So he opens up the bag and like there's nothing even in there. What is this? He points to my toiletry bag here, and I'm like I got deodorant in there. What are we talking about? Nope, so here's the thing I Travel with these hair clippers. I have this USB chargeable hair clipper set, okay because of male pattern baldness I like to keep it all kind of even you know that It's a great set of clippers. Just go ahead. Is that is that metal? Yeah, I guess Tap that black button right there in the middle hold that up to the mic whoa So that was happening in my bag apparently as it went through the scanner Now I can't even begin to speculate what the gentleman thought the item in my bag was okay But he was very insistent normally the instruction that I see is he's like I ain't touching exactly it man He's like I don't know what is making this particular sound But this time around we're gonna have you reach in there and turn off whatever is making the vibrating Well, how did he know? So okay, so I thought that the scanners Were just images. That's what I thought too But he knew that there was motion there. Yeah, maybe he felt it when he picked up the bag. I Mean I didn't feel it when I was wearing the backpack But sure enough I opened it up and that thing was in the on position just like that just buzzing and humming that makes me think that there is a Okay, well first of all do we think that the machine detected the vibration? I don't know I mean it was the most innocuous bag ever and obviously the quirk about it Is it clearly there've been other things in people's bags over the course of his career that move in a similar way that made him uncomfortable And so he wasn't gonna touch it, but I'm going how the heck that thing fire up anyway made me look stupid hair clippers Uh-huh, so I think I might just grow out like one of those like old man mullets where you just let the top go skull it Yeah, he's let the rest go so that never happens to me So I don't have that embarrassing situation at the TSA ever again did I ever tell you about my embarrassing situation and the it wasn't the TSA because it was in Peru Oh, yeah, so the PSA whatever it was I don't know So a long time ago. This was before I worked with not forgotten I was living in Coleman Alabama between he's halfway between Huntsville and Birmingham and We were gonna go down there. There's a Missionary down there that was doing some work and we wanted to go down and just like work with him See what was up, you know help him out and he really wanted us to do like a traveling not like a vacation Bible school But he had been working in all these village villages He and his wife and he wanted us just to go and do like a little fun program for the kids or whatever sure So we decided okay, we've we had these puppets, okay, and so we were gonna take these puppets and Pull a curtain like we pull a string and we put like a shower curtain kind of thing on it Oh, got a tie behind for the puppets. Yeah Yeah, we would kind of like kneel down and like stick the puppets up and like act like they were talking it was cute I really enjoyed it and so we had this one puppet that was like wanted to be an actress or whatever and she was all like Flamboyant and had like this you doing this in Spanish. Yeah. Yeah, it was a script or you just making stuff up Basically, we just played a little cassette tape. Oh, okay back in the day and then we would just do with it You know, we would it was simple. Okay, like one of the puppets was a fireman and you know all these different things One of them was this like dancer and she was like wanted to be a movie star and she had a feather boa and all this stuff When it came time to come back to the states We put all the puppets in these bags and we split the bags up. Everybody got two bags coming back and so he goes So sir, it was an American guy in Peru's like, okay, so we're getting everything ready for the flight home and We're going through all the stuff. Sir. I flagged your bag. I have to check your bag He looks at me. He goes, sir. Did you pack these bags said yes, sir? So everything in this bag is yours. Yes, sir. It is okay, and so he flops it open and it's a bag full of feather boa's He looks at me go sir. These your feather boa's I said yes, sir. They are there. They are my feather boa's Very well, sir They started calling me destiny after that Yeah, we'll do yes, sir. They are my feather boa's. Yep Protracted eye contact and everything well then for the most part the flight down was uneventful I was the worst thing that happened was right there. So that's not too bad It's not bad, but I'm glad I made the trip because I have a question for you Okay, I need your help with something that has been more of a conundrum that it will seem like it should be at first glance here Okay, I bought a raid system a capital R A I D I have no idea what that stands for but it's it's a memory system. It's a storage system Where I can get quick access for editing management of my photographs all the video clips I've shot over the years all of that stuff. So raid is a There are different levels of raid. Yes raid zero raid one right in like basically there are two hard drives For example simplest form and you put something on one hard drive and the second hard drive automatically replicates itself Yeah, sure. Yeah, so it doubles it up. Yeah, what is raid stand for? Let me let me look that up I want to know and then another configuration of a raid and correct me if I'm wrong is The data gets separated out using complex software redundant array of independent disks Okay, there you go. Yeah, so the independent disk thing is the key here. So you have more than one disk and It's like the file is Half existing in each place which gives you the speed benefit of two drives speed somehow working in conjunction But the issue there is that it's not backed up in a normal way So if any of the drives fail in your raid system and you have it configured that way It's all gone. So if you're gonna do that you have to have a boring Just mass storage puzzy slow device to back it all up on and usually I think people automate that and So I got this whole system that I bought and I got it set up took a little bit of a learning there expensive Right. Yeah, you don't factor that in when you're like I'm gonna start making content. You don't think about that. I have mountains of data and I don't want to part ways with any of it dude because my work is cumulative I do things that I really might need again someday I'd really like a shot of that one fresco in that one church in Wherever and how much would it cost me to fly back over there and get that shot again? I just want to keep it. I can tell you something cool that happened to me recently. Yeah, I got an email I'm gonna leave the specifics out. They said hey on this episode of smarter every day You interviewed my grandfather who my love he's passed on now and the other day I was feeling really sad and I went back to smarter every day and I watched my grandfather Do you happen to have any more footage of him? There you go and this episode was years old and within 10 minutes I found it huh it was years years old So it was a very interesting test for the backup system Yeah, and the problem with smarter every day the YouTube channel I do is that we have video There's slow-motion files that high-speed camera when you record it's got 96 gigabytes of RAM So if I click record I Can generate a 96 gig file like that of RAM? Yeah, yeah, it's volatile memory and so yeah, you can create a file that's that big and Then you have to back that up and so you could create terabytes of data So it's RAM like speed memory, but somehow it holds well think about what the computer is I mean what the what the thing is it's got to write files very very very quickly. Yeah, I suppose so It's just sitting there taking pictures the whole time Mm-hmm, and so you click the button and it'll just dump all those pictures as quick as it can happen And then that's some volatile memory. So if I lose power I lose that video So I have to take it from volatile memory Do you know the difference in volatile and non-volatile memory? Non-volatile is actually written it goes to a well not physical media But it's written to power down stored media. Yeah, I don't know what you call it. Yeah Yeah, exactly so if you lose power on a volatile memory device you lose the data Yeah, like if you just popped a card out of a running camera before closing the file. Yeah, it would have the same effect Yeah, yeah, so kind of well that could be recovered That's actually somewhere as we did that we did do that. I did that I remember I've done that too I was thinking of six months ago. I did that on my Sony after yeah a mountain of work It's what am I doing? Why would I why would I do that? Why would I don't why would I do the thing? It's like it's my first day at work idiot So it's a thing in volatile memory means that it's just there and for lack of a better term from the top My head is there in the cache and if you turn it off, it's gone. Yeah, okay Yeah, yeah, you have to have power to maintain the states of the bits So it's heaps of data every time you hit record on that thing. Yes for even a bajilla second Yes, I think that's the unit the bajilla second. Yeah, so long story short I was excited that I was able to find the extra footage for that for that. Yeah, that's great. Okay. Here's my question How were you able to how did you take the way your brain? Organizes things your you know, I'm into this you're invisible mental map of your Abstract data space. There's a way that you hold it in your brain and you Manifested that aspect of your imagination into a file structure on your raid system That would make sense to you that would cause you to be able to intuitively go and find this old clip to bless this dude Who's missing his grandpa and in a way? By giving him that file you gave him back another hour of his grandpa's life to go and take in that was it's a lost treasure Something that just cannot be replaced and you had it and you found it because of that How did you do it? What was your strategy for organizing that? Well, that's a big question So why are you asking first of all? Okay? Can we keep a pin in that question because that's teed up pretty well? But I'll tell you I'm asking because I'm going through a crisis right now that is caused by my having purchased a raid system I've got digital photography and video going back to the early 2000s I was a very early adopter on that technology I've cycled through a bunch of different iterations of how I organize my pictures Finally, I can tell the era of despair was the one where I was like, I'll never sort this out 2010s Cell phones in there and old hard drives and anything I could find it's just in there I'll solve it later whatever redundancies It's an Unsearchable disaster and I have been trying to go back through my digital life personal and professional and achieve what you've achieved a sense of order that is a projection onto a raid system that is reflective of how I order thoughts in my mind Not just so that it's there but so that it's there in a way that mirrors how I think of Memories and how I order those memories and I'm finding it to be really hard to just simply pick a strategy For how to organize this stuff seems like a simple thing, but it's proven to be an existential thing That's why I ask okay, so once again. I say how did you do it? Okay? First of all, this has happened in stages Okay, I have thrown an incredible amount of energy at this so the first thing I did is I bought portable hard drives. Okay, and I would use a portable hard drive for a project and Then I was like oh back in the day when I was doing this you get a hard drive about 250 gigabytes or whatever it was That's cute Yeah And then I could put stuff on there because I was recording on an old Fuji film fine picks Digital camera. That's what smarter every day first started on really. Yeah, you still have it. I do Huh? Yeah, you used an XD card. I didn't use an SD card and so That was the first camera for smarter every day and the file sizes were tiny and I would export in DV format Wow Yeah The some of the very early ones were interlaced and so I would export all this stuff And I put them on hard drives And it was just like the project name at the time my daughter I was making a lot of videos of my daughter doing silly things I like to pretend like she was a weed eating the yard and I would just film her from the bottom with goggles on like moving around And then I would film the weed eater from the top and I would just a simple cut Uh-huh. Oh, you see she's not actually we didn't you know I thought it was great Then I did Godzilla for hire Which I remember thing I did for a while and then I did some other stuff So anyway, I got all these and I just put them on a hard drive That works for a while As long as your file sizes are tiny and you can think in terms of oh, I've created a total of six videos in my entire life What do you at now? Does matter? I don't even know like for smarter every day. It's approaching 300 For like everything who knows man. I have no idea So anyway, start moving along like that and then I just oh well that hard drives full. I'll buy another hard drive So this hard drive was called cherry C H E or R Y because it's red. Oh, I see what you did Yeah, yep Oh, this one's blueberry because it was blue. That's pretty easy, right? Yeah, but I'm not understanding how this is gonna solve the problem long term Right, I can see where this is headed. Yeah, well, I mean the world is so small There are only so many colors and I mean I'm never gonna use seven hard drives are you crazy? It's only so many fruits, right? I got a bunch of these hard drives and started doing this and I was doing firewire back in the day and all this stuff And so then I realized oh wow, this is becoming a problem fast forward five years. I've got 30 hard drives I'm like, oh my goodness. This is a lot of hard drives and they don't make hard drives bigger than this. What do you do? So at that point I realized I had hard drives that did not have backups and That's when I started to understand. Oh if I drop off spinning what I call an iron wheel hard drive Okay, if I drop it while it's moving Then the reader arm will deflect against the spinning disc and it will chatter and it will scratch the disc and it will Ruin all the media on that hard drive. I did that once or twice and I was like, okay, I have to have backups So at that point I found one of my my daughter's friends mom She was really good at math and she was looking for like some supplemental income and I had Just enough money. This is before smarter every day was making money or like, you know, YouTube or wasn't a thing I Had just enough money or I could say hey For some amount of money per hour whatever it was back then maybe $15 or something that's good money. Yeah, it was a big swing because you're so organized and so good would you mind going through these hard drives and Literally writing down the file names somehow and putting them in a spreadsheet So I have a spreadsheet that has every file name that was ever made for smarter every day or Before of that. It was called penny whistle productions. I have a file name in a hard drive index The spreadsheet is called hard drive index. See what you did. Okay. I can do several things with this It all all boils back to what did I make the file folder name when I made it and also I could search by date created And so let's say for example Is there anything you remember about any smarter every day episode? Just throw anything you remember about the most obscure anything you've ever seen me make Sure, how about The moment the water comes over you when you're strapped into the helicopter crash simulation Dunker trainer. Okay, so this whole system depends on my brain So I think don't go training that happened in Hawaii and that happened with the Marines on Hawaii I know it happened in 2018 How do you know because that was the year that I left working with for the army and that was the last video I made before I left And so we're gonna depend on my brain for that much information Okay, and so then I can do other things I can go to my email and I can search a Hawaii donker training or I can search whatever. I'm gonna find a date. I'm gonna find something and Then let's just do this. Can you do it here or do we need to go to the other room? I can just do right here Okay, so I'm gonna go to my email crank this thing. I want to see okay This is already helping is it really it is okay. Yep. I have ideas Okay, I'm still in existential crisis. I'm a mess But we're going somewhere there was a thing that happened that made it easier. Okay, so I'm gonna go to I've got this particular thing So there's my hard drive index you see it I do okay, so look at all these so it's a big spread sheet Okay, this says a year on it. Okay. Do you make a new one each year? Or you just update the file name every once in a while. I'll make a new one All right, so this one's this year. I've got one that was two years ago. Okay, just whatever So in this particular thing I've got all these sheets down here and you see this one right here. This says e01 Yeah, that's a hard drive So I had hard drives a 01 a 02 a 03 and I went all the way through and then I got to a different era and smarter every day And I went to hard drive labeled B So basically I my early days early early days. I was labeling my hard drives ABCDE in a number Okay, wasn't a great system, but that's where I started. Okay, okay This is all still derivative of that decision. You made yep 15 years ago Yep, and then I go to all drives you see this yeah, and so look at the top column You see the labels of all the hard drive names. You see that I do you see there's DWS cherry There it is. Yeah, so these are all the drives that you own or have data on currently No, this is up to a certain year. So I just typed in the word dunker. Oh look at that I put it on hard drive d25 There it is that's the first time it comes up. Okay day one class This is the day one class recorded on a GoPro. This is day one class recorded on my GH5 camera Oh my goodness. You see GoPro ABC Panasonic I had three cameras. It looks like see that wow Look, there's a there's a no-dome questions episode. We recorded this on that same hard drive. See that really yeah right there Which one is it? I don't know what episode it was I can tell you a date though, huh? So isn't that cool? So yeah, it's cool. I also have an instance of it on D17 That's a different hard drive and I have another one on E12 yes a remarkable no these are the proxies these are just the proxies what what is a proxy? So proxies when you have a large file I'm sure you've done this and you asked just for the benefit of people that might not know Maybe So you have a big file and you run proxies to make a smaller version of the file So you can edit and color grade without having to use all that computational power. Yeah, so this is how I did it It's not perfect But it works for my mind So I did this for a long time if we said it's on what did we say here's another so the proxies are on hard drive e12 It's a two terabyte hard drive. Okay. I can see that that hard drive is a black Seagate this is the serial number and I've I've got 139 gigabytes left on that hard drive. Do you do all this now is this still hired out? This was hired out Like I hired this lady. It was a part-time thing, you know She did this over the course of a couple months not full-time like she do a few hours She's great Amazing right yeah The way she did it is she found a piece of software that you just plug a hard drive in and you like type in data dump on that hard drive And it would just scan everything and it would do it all So she wouldn't found a piece of hardware of software that would just do this it would scrape all the file names Okay, okay, and the folders and the structure. Okay, so then we dumped all that right here. Yes then We did that for years after that I realized if I wanted to get hard drive e12 I realized if my house burns all a smarter every day goes with it. Mmm, which is scary Mmm. So I got a safety deposit box and I created a hard drive and the backup and I kept them in two physical locations I kept all the backups in the safety deposit box and the hard drives at my house Then after a while I was like, you know, I don't need all these hard drives. I'd rather have them in a safe place I just had two safety deposit boxes Until the day I needed something and it was like a sunday. Oh Like okay, I can't do that. So fast forward I reached out to or I forget how it worked out Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips. I talked to him about what can I do and he had this relationship with a company called 45 drives Okay, and so we installed I did a smarter everyday episode on this we installed a raid hard drive system Sorry, I missed this episode. It's not ringing a bell. No, this is something we did We have that but the problem is it wasn't fast enough to edit off of what why not because they were spinning hard drives It was a raid array But you just couldn't get because I had it in 4k footage same So I just couldn't I Couldn't push the data that I needed I needed a blowtorch of a data stream. Okay, so fast What do you mean by blowtorch? What would be the speed that you're hoping to gig it gigabit ethernet access? Okay, so fast forward to now and now the way I handle my what I call the deep vault is an LTO drive Do you know what that is? No, I do not linear tape optimized That's a magnetic tape backup what? It's a magnetic tape. That's here at your house. Yeah, show me okay. I'm here right. No, I mean, let's just here Let's just walk go in on a few true So it's actual tape like our yeah ancestors used yeah Yeah, this is it right here. So this is huge. This is a Magstore tape backup drive See that and it looks like an eight track player. It does. Yeah, and so this specific type of tape is called LTO 8 So that's it right there. It's a cartridge it looks like an eight track like that Yeah, that's absurd. So that's 12 terabytes. No There's actually an LTO 9 now This tape backup drive is quite expensive. I think it's not it was very it was a big investment It's like I want to say four thousand dollars. Oh my good. It's nuts, dude. It's crazy But I've paid that much for one piece of equipment ever and it was my editing computer. Yeah, that's the biggest outlay I've ever had so this thing right here once you make that initial investment of the tape backup drive Yeah, or whatever you want to call that then you buy these tapes and they're like 50 bucks a piece Okay, that's pretty cheap for exactly set terabyte. So like 12 the dollar per gigabyte This is the most optimized storage you can get and is in terms of storage. It's the best long-term solution Magnetic tape is better than a solid state drive My understanding I could be wrong about it. Solid state drives are so expensive for yeah in terms of dollar per gigabyte Yeah, but this is the way and so even Amazon like if you were to buy AWS Amazon web services or whatever it's called basically you pay Amazon to store your data on the cloud They use tape backup do they really they do yeah, and they have robotic systems that will go Literally robots that will go and pull a tape out of the Dewey decimal type deal I don't know how they do it, but they have barcodes They will literally have robots scan barcodes and they know where everything is it's it's amazing So that's a deep storage. You're not accessing that like Google Drive. You're correct. The AWS. I mean correct, but this You all you have to do is know which tape backup you would need and then how do you actually access it? Does this connect is ethernet to the whole system? Absolutely the unfortunate part about this is that it's loud So it's it's off right now. Okay, so when I the other day how loud yeah, I'll see let me turn it on here It's a power switch in the back. I just turned it on here. It's been up. Oh I do Okay, it's not the end of the world loud. That's not it. Yeah, it's not going up. Oh, there's a tape in there right now Nope. Nope. It's it's just now wicked. I okay It has to spool up everything you see it coming online I do problem is with tape if you think about how tape works If you have data on a disc like literally the geometric description of a disc You just move over the disc to get what you want. Correct. Well here you have to go to the tape like The olden days when I wanted to play a cassette you can't skip between tracks like a CD you have to fast forward or rewind and Spool it out to get where you want on the magnetic tape exactly you hear it waking up now. I do hear it It's still not appallingly loud Okay, yeah, it's online right now, but do you hear that high frequency whine? I do so that's annoying to me so what I'm gonna do is I'll put this tape in And listen to it grab and pull it in It's really old school Oh Wow This feels like throwback technology it doesn't feel new Yeah, but in terms of being able to store the most amount of stuff. That's that's it. That's how you do it Huh, so then you can see you here on the computer. Yeah, you have to mount that drive Sure now this particular tape is empty I formatted it wrong and I named it incorrectly and so I've I've set this one aside You see it's still not mounted the problem with this Okay, it's pulling up here. It is it gonna school through that whole thing in order to mount the drive now My understanding of how it works is that it has a little portion of the tape in one section where it kind of keeps up with what's on it this computer It's just a little I don't know if you can see it like that's the tape backup drive It's it's in a network rack. Yeah, but I have a little Mac mini back here. I did not see that Let me it's a little Mac computer right here. Gosh. It looks like a router Well, oh yikes. You're waking up Okay, that's loud Okay, it was done. It just This is a program right here called canister All of these right here. These are all my tape backup drives that have been indexed Oh my goodness, and if you double click in any one of those that is what is on that? Okay, so that's give what I'm looking at right now in your file explorer is what is indexed But if you double click on that we can't pull it up right now. We have to put in the tape. Correct. Obviously. Yeah Okay, now I'm feeling more intimidated I Learned something I like to the learning. I've looked at this robot many times and thought that's a lot of jumper cables And that's patch cables. Yeah, I mean, that's just a lot. We heading back to the mics. Yeah That's expensive and a lot man But your stuff is like groundbreaking footage of like slow motion tracking the snap of a whip and all my stuff's just mostly fart jokes I mean, there's some really funny ones. No, like stuff people haven't thought of before dude putting edge fart jokes. Well, what What are you well, so okay? So that's smarter every day. That's how I do that when I got through the hard drive thing. Mm-hmm then I Just have a little network drive like 20 gigabytes. That's pretty significant sure But then I'll edit off of the network drive So I'll have a few projects going at any one time and then once I finish the project then I'll dump it to an LTO. Okay, that's where I'm at now And so now I never have that step where I go to something else, you know, like I go to some weird hard drive in between So now I just say date I'll say I go to a kids sports event. I will just go year-month date or Smarter every day episode number. That's what I do now. Okay. Yeah So you got on deck active and archived and that's pretty much it exactly. Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right Is this helpful at all? Yes. Oh, it's very helpful I've often wondered how you do all of this because you just have a ton of data management But you said that's the smarter every day side What do you do on the personal side with all the photographs and Family stuff or if you take a trip travel, how do you keep track of where all that is? So you saw on the Canister index you saw that one Standout it was one LTO that said Sandlin family you see that and so that's where if I want wedding photos. I'm going there You know, I got stuff there and it's all organized by year You went year. Yeah, and then I will go in and dump my phone every year and You just call that destined 20 iPhone back up When I had a Samsung destined Samsung backup piece of crap 2017 no, it was a piece of crap garbage. No, it was a beautiful thing about the Android stuff as there was a There's a card in it. I could just dump it all the cards really nice. It's very nice. Yeah, I like that. Yeah Huh you went by year. That's interesting to me. Okay. Well, let's start on the the work side Can I impact my system a little bit and you can give me some therapy here and some of you do okay? This episode of notable questions is supported by listeners like you who? Are crazy enough to pitch in and make it keep going so we can pay people like Tina who's editing this thing that I'm doing right now What we did is we asked people on a note of questions patreon page. We said hey We reached out directly to people said would you be willing to tell us why you support? Because we kind of want to study you in a lab and understand what's going on in your mind So we can try to replicate you so that we have financial freedom with this thing And then we got a response from Andrew It was upside down and backwards, but we had to reverse the audio and flip it back over I don't know why it was like that, but but we'll uh, we'll go ahead and play it for you now And uh, we'll hear from Andrew. G'day fellas Andrew here. Thanks for making life better for me and my family of eight in the land down under We started listening very early on it became winged to sours in 2019 My son just saw I put it best when he said it's nice to have something funny and formative and genuinely interesting to listen to while still being clean Our favorite part so far have been anything barnacles and testicles the red baron Caesar Miracles boner urinal confessions pv equals nt and sleep paralysis We honestly love you guys and if you're ever in queen san Australia, we'd be happy to have you around for a feat Andrew did I understand correctly like we can come visit you for a fee like we have to Okay. Thank you, Andrew Or grateful that uh, Andrew supports on patreon.com slash notom questions. It means the world seriously, Andrew It's uh, it's a big deal. So we're grateful if you feel at all like Andrew does Except you don't live in australia and you would like to support we would appreciate your support on patreon. Thank you very much Okay, my first camera was a panasonic Pointing shoot. Mm-hmm I mean it was just a simple little panasonic about the size of a baseball card but it had a Nice optical zoom lens on it and it had the same sensor as the gh Four maybe the four Maybe whatever was before It had a great sensor. It really it looked pretty good. It always wanted to cheat orange Really nudged toward warm all the time Uh, it might have been just my own mistakes, but I I think it it really leaned that way It had a certain look to it Certain distortion to that lens And you know it's fine. It's a good place to start whatever I didn't even have like microphone audio I used to taskam stand-up recorder. I hide it behind a mug My desk when I started it's all echoey and terrible now I know we just you learn things as you go along and everything you learn seems to take up more space So then I went to uh canon that I bought at target one time I didn't really understand that you probably shouldn't buy your professional work camera at target if you can help it But I found a little kit and it's what I could afford my second camera was a canon t1i. Yeah I think I had the Consumer I had a rebel like that you remember the yeah, that's what angry augusty camera Yeah, the t1i was the first digital rebel. Okay. Yeah, I had that it was cheap and plastic Did okay. I bought some lenses for it. You know, it just wasn't ever a great look Uh, my buddy Nate and I always called it the tandy or the texas instruments or that you know Like any old brand we could take up. That's now mostly defunct. We'd call it that Then I got a gh4. I mean I just I looked at your gear That's what you were using I managed to find one for cheap used on ebay and as a good camera, but the auto focus was trash So finally eventually the final form was saved at my pennies. I bought a sony a7s 3 Oh, brother. It's good. It's invincible. It's so amazing So the reason I haven't I heard a lot of people like the a7s 3 but the reason I don't use that is the selfie cam is Important to me. Yeah, a lot of smarter every day. I flip that screen out to the side to me as well Yeah, can you do that? Oh, I got it. Yeah. Oh really? Oh, yeah, yeah I mean that was an absolute deal breaker if I couldn't do it If I'm doing the walk and talk Like a self-guided tour of something or I want to explain some stained glass or Speculate about some art in a church or a sculpture or something I will flip that little monitor around I can see myself and it just throws a box around one eye and if the box is there It means we are locked in on that auto focus whereas that's awesome with the panasonic I get that like blue zebra kind of stuff. Yeah, and it loves my beard Uh-huh and so it lies and it says i'm in focus when i'm not because there's something about the way it reads a beard Uh-huh that lies So I intentionally Have to cheat it out of focus according to the zebra ink in order to make it look like it's working It just doesn't work for that. So you think about yes, so when i'm making a video The amount of things that are going on in my head When i'm talking to somebody about rockets on a video is ridiculous and most of it's not about rockets. Yes Yeah, dude. I'm not as good at this as you are, but I totally understand I'm trying to Listen to the orthodox priest who kind of doesn't like me anyway Tell me about the shrine and he's sort of frustrated that I exist Yeah, yeah And i'm trying to listen to him talk about st. Phodios and his anathemas regarding the philly oak Philly oak wick laws lisha in the ninth century, but also i'm like Oh, but dude, you're telling me that standing right under that light and it's giving you raccoon eyes Absolutely and i'm just gonna awkwardly get closer to you until you feel weird and move back out of that light Yeah, i'm running those kind of calculations and Yeah, i don't know what i'm doing, but i've got a ton of footage of me not knowing what i'm doing And so my workflows gradually become what yours is i got the on deck circle And literally that's what i call the folder on deck circle Edit these at some point. I mean i've got 30 videos viable videos in the can right now that i just haven't got to yet Wow, because i kind of have to stagger what tradition i do I can't do like five catholic videos in a row where the algorithm thinks i'm catholic and it doesn't give my videos to anybody else anymore So i have to pepper it with different traditions and different ideas Or i just end up more in the dog house than i already am So i got the on deck circle then i get the active editing folder And then i i've had the archives which is just this ever growing 12 terabyte Amazon.com stack of mega hard drives you have to physically plug into power And then you have to run usb connection i'm out of ports It's overdone. I can't edit off of any of these And so finally i was like all right. I'm gonna try to do what you did now I saw in there that you had a qnap system correct. That's what i went and bought wow And that's a swing man. Is it i mean i mean it's expensive it was expensive. Yeah, about it used okay that helped And what i found was the thing supposed to be run through my ethernet Yeah, set up and then i can get 10 10 gig i can get 10 gig out of it. Okay It's all in the wrong room. I didn't want long cables whatever i'm like i just run it direct And have it all happen offline. I found a way to cheat that i can get 2.5 out of it that way Okay, I just cannot believe how quickly i can access whatever i have in there 30 36 i mean it's Massive ton that 36 terabytes maybe 30 terabytes It's great. You're the spigger than mine. I think i think i'm at 20 terabytes Yeah, there's a lot there and it flies and i'm running at a quarter of the speed That it's capable of when i get the setup all right. So i'm very excited about that I've been working on a backup system and all of that's well and good I think my professional workflow is starting to come together What isn't coming together is trying to fileize my personal life It's out of control man And so then i sat down I bought this system like all right i'm gonna partition this little bit over here metaphorically Not like i actually make a partition. I know it's not that kind of drive And i'm gonna i'm gonna take this section over here I'm gonna organize tens of thousands of pieces of media about my kids and my life and Even stuff i've written. I want to go in there personal recordings Things from my i want to try to archive recordings of my great grandparents that i still have Like i want this to be the treasure trove if you find This drive You found it the historian would know what to do with this if you wanted to tell such a story But the one remaining question how do i order it you went by years So i started going by years But then i started being like well i'm missing on so many of these and i'd go and verify and i missed by four years It's just memory. It's too much time. I had an experience very similar to this in 2003 and Say 2008 Which one was that i looked the same in both of those years And so i'm i discover i'm starting to make mistakes with where they go Not from like you know hardcore forgetfulness or slippin or anything But they were similar trips similar circumstances is not working And i realized that i think the best way for me to do this and i want you to help me troubleshoot it because i'm not positive or convinced Is by location I think i think more in terms of space than i do in terms of timeline Which is a history person seems really weird you would think timeline would be Obviously how i would think about the past But it's so much more natural for me to sort this stuff by This is how it currently looks and this is just an iteration The first level of my folder of all of my images and memories and everything is Countries was it so i mean the united states is pinned because i'm there a lot And then inside of that is cities or subregions So for the united states it's all states So a very busy folder for me is united states Wyoming And then uh down to city from there So united states, yoming yellow stone At that point it seems like i am more or less get what i want to and then i can just sort by date And i'm gonna bend the yellow stone 50 times So how am i gonna sort through all those pictures? Well, i guess i just have to go with whatever date is tagged on the photo to try to make sense of the thing So before i ask you my next question Upside downside of that what do you see as being the problem if i put more time into that and go further down this road What am i gonna run into 30 years from now that it's going to be a problem sorting it that way now? Let me ask you this what is the purpose of sorting the files? I don't know I just don't want it to get more out of control Wait some obvious purposes Um, i'd like to have the footage anything i've taken a picture of is free archival footage that i can use on projects That's really nice to have also I suppose this is it I want someone to look at the stuff i did someday Not the stuff i published The stuff i did I hope my kids or grandkids will be curious about it I'm making a bucket of skipping rocks that i find all around the world anywhere i find a cool skipping rock I grab it i throw it in the bucket The bucket is only to be used by the first generation of kids after i am gone I'm thinking in those categories i live in a time Where people at generation after i am dead who are my descendants can kind of know me If i make it hard, they're not going to know me If i make it easy, i can be a part of their life a little bit and This hard drive to me is I'm young i'm healthy i'm happy i plan on being alive for a very very very long time But it's kind of one of the disciplines in my life right now where i realize i'm sort of preparing for death I'd like to make sense of it. I don't want to ask somebody else later to have to do this work It's my responsibility and i should make sense of it Suppose it's what i'm trying to accomplish Have you ever cleaned out a house when someone dies i've cleaned out a room when a kid brother died Yeah Can you keep everything? No, we didn't It was hard Yeah, i think if mark had been 91 when he died It would have been a lot easier to clean that place out But he was 18. Yeah, that made every single item absolutely better I we did it in one day. Yeah, and i still have the items i picked And we're moving some stuff around right now in my life. We have a little bit of chaos And so i got my one bucket of memory stuff Like i pop that thing open it is a musty version, but it still smells like him The tiniest little bit right? So i'm glad i saved something But also i'm glad i'm not moving moving 40 boxes of whatever my brother happened to own when he was 18 You just can't keep it all look behind you right there See those boxes right there the white ones yeah, yeah, those are film photos that i shot really Yeah, i grabbed that right now. That's what's in there. Yeah, grab any one of those Yep, and so Those are film photos. I have them digitally backed up. Can i can open it? Yeah, okay Yeah, okay, so that's medium format film. I just you're not gonna want to unwind what you can use wind it I'll just go a tiny a little bit. Yeah, just hold it up to the light You got two of them there you want to separate it so you just i want to just look at one picture in time It's better. Yeah, those are film photos And they mean something to me and the cool thing about the film is that it was physically there Whatever you're looking at there the film was there. Can you figure out what it is? Just by looking at it. It's surprisingly difficult to figure out what i'm looking at right now, but i'm not giving up The point is those boxes over there they're not very organized But i've got them organized digitally because they have scans of all those But i still like the idea of keeping the negative If you look right here between you and either's a drawer. Oh, these are kids They're playing in like a children's play area. There's like a fire pole And a kiddo is sliding down a fire pole That's cool. It's playing on like Uh, it looks like a big like a mushroom pad to kind of see it for something. Oh, really? Yeah See See that doesn't mean a lot to you Let me see next roll. Oh the next roll. Yeah, that looked like the ocean Oh, that's my son at a high jump. Well, I was not close on that. That's what that one was Let's see what this one is Oh, that's uh They're at a uh a trampoline place a trampoline part. Okay, so the kids are trampoline part It's cool. So that means a lot to me Because it's their youth and childhood and all that so I have a plan Eventually to go through those And just take time and go through those but look at this drawer right here between us. All right, see these Those look much older. Yeah, I have one of those. Yeah Okay, let me describe this here This looks read it. It looks like a wallet it's Old it smells smells like a very old book from the library It says Eastman negative album capacity 100 size two and a half by four and a quarter All right, uh So the date on there. So these are photos from a man named Robert Kennedy You've shown me some of the stuff that you ended up with from Robert Kennedy. No relation No relation to the politician, but not in this format. I haven't seen these kind of these books at all What is this? How does it work? So basically these are Envelopes that are all assembled in a book and in the envelopes You can see he's got him numbered as best I can tell this individual Robert Kennedy. He was quirky He seems to be very intelligent. He may have been some level of autistic perhaps. I don't know Maybe that's not fair. Maybe he's just organized But the person I bought these from they went through and they started selling these negatives on ebay And I found one from my hometown and it was a photo that I had taken with a modern camera So he dained to point his camera at one you had pointed your camera Correct and I was looking for old photo negatives on ebay one night and I found the cow's I wait a second I took that photo But this guy took it like 60 years before me And so look on the first few pages he's organized everything. Yeah Read a few of those through it. I want to see more of these locations treat it this what i'm hoping is that i'm gonna Know some of these places looks like he took the pictures in the 1950s Uh view from lookout mountain. There's a lot of lookout mountains table rock, tennessee Okay, so that's a lookout mountain in chat nougat along rock river near organ Viewed from castle rock, Illinois Roosevelt car 1929 st. Louis cathedral new orleans state capital indianapolis bridal covered oaks palm city palm drive City park. Oh lake ponchitrain. Yeah, so this guy took these photos I don't know what kind of camera he took them with but they're beautifully shot and he organized them and then he died and somebody got his photos a uh, an estate salesman bought these and started going through them And selling the ones that had value for example in indianapolis, indiana You know, if you had a restaurant there, you might want an old photo of indianapolis You'll you'll notice those are sold out of the the books So the photos that are left lever The ones that are left here. We still have remnants And like if this is almost like you know in the bible where it says and and the rest of the story is recorded in the book of edo Yeah, whatever. Sure. It's like that. And so You see where there was a photo of read one of them as for the other events of his reign Are they not all written down in the book of jashers? Exactly. Yeah, okay So for example right here, there's there's an empty spot The palisades on the hudson river Photo 749 that's not here. I bet that was salable. Oh, no, no actually i've got it right here Look at that boat. Look at that boat. He took pictures of the world's fair in chicago Did he really century of progress midway chicago Yeah, that one's that Isn't that cool? So I bought these from a dealer in mizuri The reason I bought them is because I have been accused in the past of having a uncontrollable desire to document things who accused you of that They didn't accuse me. It's a mutual friend of ours. I said They said I don't have whatever it is you have where you feel like you have to document everything Okay, I don't think I have to document everything, but I like to I purchased these photos Because i opened another one while you talk sure because I realized that This individual did exactly what I do And documents their life Yeah And nobody is looking at the photos through the eyes of the individual People only valued these photos because it's an old photo of a place that they know in modern times But I want to look at the photos from the perspective of mr. mr. Kennedy's life. Does that make sense? Yes What have you found just an interesting person? He really liked model trains. He really liked actual trains um, he likes bridges He finds natural Landscapes interesting I don't know he finds the same kind of places I find interesting interesting right he's got savanna, Illinois My family's from there really yeah, he went to savanna, Illinois snap pictures Straight up my grandpa's berry there really yeah, this funeral was there this guy was well traveled. It's awesome Dubuque, Iowa I grew up 20 minutes from Dubuque, Iowa when I was a little little kid I lived in eastern, Iowa for a while. My mom is from that part of the world the Chicago world fair century of progress 1938 He's there taking pictures and all that stuff. Uh, look at this He's taking pictures. Oh What is it? Oh, he can't show me the thing. It's a new don't mess this one up this statue That's in new Orleans. That's french quarter new Orleans. That's Jackson. That's the jackson's that's hander jack I just shot a statue video At Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. talking about that statue. Yes, I know exactly what we're looking at That's amazing. And so like dude I went and sat in front of this statue and I took a video of this and this joker shot it Yes with his camera. Yes, and I randomly pulled that out Man, that's that's astonishing So are you okay? As this pertains to my conundrum about why I want to organize these files and the best way to do it You have a good organizational mind As it pertains to that are you saying mr. Kennedy wasted his time organizing this stuff because nobody looks at it now Or that it has value because you chose to buy it Or that it has value because just implicitly it has value and organizing it was a gift to the future Tie it in for me. The gentleman that I bought these from He's a nice man. He's in Missouri I contacted him and I said, hey, man. Are you selling these one at a time? He's like, yeah, I was like you're breaking them up He's like, well, yeah, I can make more money that way. I said what would it take for just take them all off ebay He only sold them in you know batches of a couple dozen at a time He's like dude. I I have so many more of these. I'm just doing it slowly. I said well Can I just buy everything you have on ebay right now? I think he was selling for like somewhere between five and fourteen hours a piece depending on what the photos were So I bought several of them and then I talked to him and I I bought the whole lot like his whole Everything he had And it's my understanding that I just recently called this guy again and he found some more what? Yeah, except this time he found Kodachrome slides color. So mr. Kennedy documented all these things From whatever this era is all the way up to the 60s And so I'm I told the gentleman I was like, hey, don't mail them to me I'd like to come see you and and get them from you Just because I want to have a conversation with him because I think he's cool So anyway, I say all this to say you want people to go back in time and look at your life And that's what i'm doing with this guy And I don't know him and I don't know what to do with this But but I I find it to be interesting One thing i'm really interested in is i'm thinking about scanning all of these and then putting them just putting them out there putting them together Some of the shots he took were brilliant. I mean we're gonna turn off mics here in a minute And i'm gonna sit here and continue to look through every last one of these it's cool, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's super cool and i'm so disappointed There's a shot that I just found here that's called chicago lakefront 1933 I would want to see that picture. I lived in chicago for five years. It's gone. Yeah, of course. It's gone Dang it. Right. Yeah, but you can apparently this from chicago Uh, yeah, I got his address right here. Yeah, he wrote it down. Yep, chicago proper 10 13 31 Third 1931 that's what it says. It's about 100 years old. This has an incredible value to me because of the humanity of it. Yes And I feel a connection with this guy right now because at some point he thought to himself How can I organize my files up in such a way? That there's some record of these travels and the stuff I saw And there's some cohesive story he edited. This isn't everything he curated And in a way 100 years later. I don't know when mr. Kennedy died say 100 years later This is one of the few visual remnants of his life Yeah, and here you and I are talking about it with a whole bunch of people sitting in the third chair And the fact that he put in the thought and the effort Is not to be sappy a blessing to us I want My stuff that's the product of my eye and my priorities and what I think is beautiful or interesting I want to put in the work to curate that in a way that is Considered to people in the future the same way that when I hold this little booklet from mr. Kennedy He didn't know he was doing me specifically a favor But he did because if it was just a giant dump of stuff there's something interesting in there somewhere good luck future people I wouldn't be holding it But that this guy was careful and thoughtful about other people potentially seeing his work Is why I get to enjoy it and see it now wouldn't be in my hand otherwise So I want to organize it in a way that is sort of my brain proof a little bit And so maybe I should go by years the way you're doing it. I mean, I'm probably getting close to a work week into it Effortwise, I mean, I've really got some work in it But there's still time for me to change my organizational strategy To make it thoughtful for people in the future But I found this guy because he organized by place I disagreed with you at first when you're you're like, yeah, I should do it by place I was just sitting there saw that in your eyes. Yeah, you saw it. I was sitting there thinking man That's crazy. That doesn't make any sense and then I thought about these I was like, okay Like for me in order for me to access the information and find it quickly It's got to be by year because then I can go to my my email address and I can find it Oh Like give me another thing. I mean just whatever. Can you think of any other smarter everyday things? Yeah, of course, uh, gravity light gravity light. Okay, great So I went to solesbury cathedral and I did that. I have no idea what year that is So I'm just gonna go to the old swag. I'll just go the spreadsheet here Yeah, there it is Uh d29 that's incredible 2017. Did you know that was in 2017? No, I had no idea It's all in hard drive eo2 My method Of year on my folders only works with this and I've often thought If something happens to me The proverbial bus that's gonna hit me that we always talk about Like my kids are not going to know what to do with this No, they're not going to this guy made it easy. He just wrote it down So you maybe need one more iteration of this as well But also Dude your kids don't need to look through 50 failed attempts to light a match with a 22 that's been fired From a bolted stationary rifle. I would watch edgerton do that Harold edgerton at mit I would watch him do that But my kids don't need to because they have to live their own life They don't need to see all 50 attempts is the point they need to see a couple that failed and one that worked to get the story But that's not what they would be watching for What would they be watching for if they watched 50 slow motion videos of you trying to do something? They wouldn't watch the slow motion videos They would watch me and john henry in the garage And they would see us mess up and they would see if we laughed or if we got mad That's what they would figure out and they'll be like oh John henry Laughing they keep screwing it up and he keeps laughing. That's great. They were pretty positive That's kind of his power isn't it if it himself on cctv cameras. Yeah Seems like he's real good at that. He's really good at that Okay, final question. Okay. What about editing? Oh gosh. What if you no no no I mean in process of curation So let's say you go on the same journey. I'm on right now and you're like i'm gonna take iphone 2019 And i'm gonna organize up those pictures so future generations don't have to and so I make some kind of sense of this story learn things about myself preserve things for the future whatever and let's say you're going through it and There's a picture that isn't super evergreen A joke that was funny in 2019 but wasn't funny three months later But whoever sees it down the road isn't gonna know what news were the event happened three months later And they're not gonna get it and it just looks dumb and you won't be there to explain it Do you delete that or is there some moral obligation To just be like nope. That's my life. These are the pictures we took. That's where we were. I don't I can't think of anything that would I don't know. I've never clearly you have not gone back through and curated I've never heard to think about that and no why do you think it well because I would have my answer to that question would have been I keep don't think There's a single picture i've ever taken that I would be like oh, I don't really like the way that reflects I'm fine with all of it until I went and started doing this yeah Yeah, and then there's a few where i'm like huh Yeah, that sort of needs a little context to get it It almost feels like that picture tells a little different story than the actual story Oh interesting if you're standing there and you can see what's happening off camera The whole thing makes perfect sense and in the moment we're like well, we'll remember forever Okay, we can fill in the rest of the story But when i'm not there to fill into the rest of the story There were a few pictures was like the most natural way to interpret that would be not in a way that I would find particularly Flattering or accurate or reflective of what it actually was Maybe i'll just make that one go away But then I hover over the delete button Is that dirty is that dishonest so so someone that I love dearly sent me a photo the other day that they they found a photo It's this person you know that person I think I do okay. Yep. Yep. I know that person sure so this person sent me a photo of them Without context and if you look at it now Yep, if you look at it now that photo doesn't work Right, but there's a lot of layers as to why that makes sense then yes And doesn't make sense now. Yes, that simply doesn't mean the same thing. Yes when I assume that photo was taken Yep, simply doesn't yeah, I see what you're saying is my point If you became the custodian of that common acquaintance of yours and mine Yeah If you became the custodian of their hard drive that they left behind their raid system with all their pictures on it You're like, I'm gonna go through this thing before anybody else gets a look at it You come across that one. Do you just delete it? Yeah You do? Yeah Okay Yeah, I came across something from somebody one time. I was like, yeah, that's going away That's going down the forever hole Was it me? No, it wasn't okay. No I can't think of anything. I was like dude. I think I'd want to know but wait a second. I tell me No, no, no, no, I I can remember seeing something male like yeah That's not who that person was taking out a context. This looks bad. I made that decision You know what I'm thinking of I do. Yeah, it's it's such a weird weird story But I was the custodian of something one time And I made an executive decision to be like Yeah, that's out of context when it's going away. I think that's fine. It's exactly in context and it's going away like It's either way It's going away. I don't know if it's a function of the moment in life that I'm in but I am Camilla when we were having kids she felt clearly a biological impulse toward nesting We got to get this place That it's I mean, it's been like a gamer lounge for us to hang out in watch shows and bum around It's functional so we can get out and do all the things we do want to do anything at home Anyway, who cares all of a sudden? Who is this lady? She's got a little bump on her tummy and now all she wants to do is Look at cribs and pastel paint colors Like she just transformed before my eyes priority wise In the same way that I watched that happen almost as a function of biology for her I am feeling this deep impulse to curate and for the first time ever I'm really feeling a desire to be thoughtful toward people after I am gone Even though I do not anticipate being gone in any kind of foreseeable future I'm just starting to feel interested in that It's like my messy hard drives are a metaphor for a narrative-less life I know the narrative. I'm the keeper of it. I like it. Even the bad parts. I like my narrative. I get my story I can track it almost like a A waveform that ups and downs peaks and valleys all of that. I can see my picture Or I can I can see my story on a graph almost like that Nobody else probably can or not many other people probably can and so all those pictures Stuff I wrote little word files things like that. It all kind of adds up to telling a story I don't need to totally curate it so that I inflict my version of my story on other people But I'd like it to be organized enough that people could get a little bit of a taste of it We're not presidents man Paper's arpeya our papers aren't going to go to a library Right, it's not like we're Isaac Newton and well there were some correspondence between these two scientists back in You know, are people going to read your emails? You think well, I'm not making any effort on that so I mean Go ahead. I could self-out. Did you know that sticker mule is new doing another promotion get 19 right exactly for 50 buttons Yeah, enjoy my email suckers. I don't clean any of that garbage Right, I don't know do people whose stuff gets gone through because something Meaningful happened in their life know that the whole time But did they know that when they're 20 or 25 or 40 when do you get notified people are going to go through all your stuff later and care about it? I don't know. I don't know either So probably not but I'm not thinking of famous. I'm not and I don't intend to be that I'm thinking of family history Dude, I'd go through everything If I had valentine white mens hard drive. I want to know we get these huge gaps I would love to read what edward white men was thinking in his journal from prison After the first time he got burned and then recanted and got taken off the stake by king james And then was like now that's actually what I believe and then actually stayed on the stake and got burned all the way to death What happened in his brain between burning number one a board of burning number one and full-fledged burn? You tell you die number two I would love to know that I'm a part of something much bigger than myself family wise So I kind of like this to be an arc a preservation of memory for the family Everything I learned about my ancestors. I feel like I kind of get me for better or for worse more I don't know that it's for like some sort of grand archival self-important thing but I kind of like to be generationally present in ways that some of the generations before me were not Is that bad? I mean maybe maybe that is narcissistic. I don't know. I think my family has way too much access to me If I'm tired of hearing myself when you're editing, you know what it's like when you're editing and you're like you hear yourself 10 times That's why we have Tina do this. Yeah Dude, I can't do anymore Jeff gets the daily thing Tina gets this and it's still too much Yeah, yeah, I don't want to inflict more of me Okay on the future generations Okay, I mean that's an interesting thing right like I I was listening to a comedian He was talking about the amount of access you have to your grandmother And he was saying like look my grandmother. I've got some some old film photos of her opening presence in christmas in the 70s, right? future generations They're gonna have tick-tock videos of their grandma twerking. Yeah, they are. Yeah. Yeah, right? That's gonna happen Yeah, yeah, yeah of their grandma twerking at their grandma's funeral Or whatever. I don't know what they do on tick-tock, but that seems like the kind of thing that would happen. You know what I mean? Like Like we're we're just making digital tattoos all over the place To run the other way do less I don't know this what I know for sure. I don't know what I'm gonna do with it What I do know is it's a mess and it kind of feels like a metaphor for a messy unkempt narrative And I'd at least like to just put it in some folders instead of one big dumpster folder I think my brain would feel better And if you're telling me that you don't see any obvious deep pitfalls to the approach that I'm taking Then I think I'll just keep taking it and we'll let somebody else sort out whether that was worthwhile So one thing I do and I think I mentioned this on the podcast before is I have a a secret youtube channel With unlisted videos It's for the family While you're doing this, let's say you go through and you find yellow stone 2018 Every video clip in that just throw it on a w premiere on the timeline and then just export it And then scrub it real fast to make sure like, you know, the kids aren't swimming in a pool or something Whatever, you know, they they fall out of their bathing suit or something like that. Just scrub it real quick. Make sure everything's cool and then make an unlisted video And send the link to that unlisted video to your family. Yes. I didn't know if we were talking about that into microphones Yeah, but that's the other layer to this project. Yeah, I do have the same youtube channel And i'm working to populate it with all of this stuff. Yeah Yeah, I want to preserve some stuff and I want uh mom and dad on both sides to have access to that and Kind of savor it a little bit more. Yeah A thing that I found that I really value is voice recordings Tuck in my daughter in at night. That's a big one That's a big one. And so i'm thinking like what happens if I get old and I lose my eyesight or something like that It'd be really nice to hear that You know, and then it'd be cool. I sing to my kids at night. I think it'd be really cool to record that and just Let them have a copy of that. That's cool. Yeah, I did a voice recording the other day Um, actually, I think I sent it to you. It's something I might listen to someday when i'm old Just in bed I want to remember just being in a big argument with a random guy Mm-hmm. Y'all on that me a lot That was funny That was real funny. He was really mad. He was very mad. Dude, nothing new You did a great job, but I had the presence of mind to record it so you could be entertained Thank you for that. Yeah, you bet Uh, thanks for helping me game it out, dude. And thanks for walking me through your system I'm on the front end of this, but I feel like this whole process work-wise and personal wise I every time I take ground I put an hour into it a couple hours into it I feel a little more ordered. Yeah, I don't know what that means psychologically I don't think I said it very well, but I like the way it feels to start pulling this together Instead of every day that goes by it becomes more chaotic that feels bad This thing i'm trying to do now, even though it's obviously very imperfect feels good like toward an ordered life toward an ordered mind toward an ordered Story fighting entropy. Yeah, cool. Thanks for indulging me on this. It was genuinely helpful I wanted your help on it and you have helped me on it. I appreciate it. Thanks, dude.
