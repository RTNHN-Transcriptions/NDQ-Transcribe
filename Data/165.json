Is that what we're doing? Oh, it's already hitting you with the butt. Yeah, we're going outside to play baseball. When's the last time you played catch with somebody? My son and I played, let's say back in the late spring, early summer. When's the last time you played adult catch with another man? I'd say church softball. How long ago was that? Probably last year. But that was part of a formal activity. Yeah. You didn't have a man say, hey, let's go play catch. I did not know what you just did. Me throwing the ball in my glove here. Okay. Throw it to you. That's a good start. Let's move you away from that vehicle so I don't crunch it. You say that squirrel just dropped that thing on me. Yeah. That was really good. Here you go. I got it. My goodness, dude. That's your third throw. And you're just in full velocity mode. That was sorry. No, why are you apologizing? That was a good pop. Real good pop. Dude, I'm old. We're going to do this for 30 minutes. Only 30 minutes. Come on, man. What do you do right now, sports wise? Do you go out and throw the ball around with people, play basketball? No, nothing. I don't, man. Your circle of friends doesn't do that. I don't know. I'm just in a weird place. I used to love playing ball, baseball, like loved it, but just busy. And I'm the backup guy for the church softball team. And so I do two things when I go. So I'm the guy that just generally tries to get people excited. Like try to pump them up. Okay, I can see that. But I usually play shortstop, third, or rover. Rover's the thing in church softball. What do you like playing best? Uh, rover. Just because you're involved in everything. You're involved in everything, but plus you can, uh, you can mess with people a little bit. Like you can play one position and when the softball is pitched, you can run to another. And so in softball, you can try to hit it where you want to hit it. Cause a slow pitch softball, right? Yeah, a slow pitch softball. It's not crazy. Yeah. And, uh, you can kind of mess with people because you can place it if you're a good enough hitter. And so when I know a guy's up to bat and he's going to place it, let's say, dink it right over the second baseman. That's typically around where the rover is. I'll get in that position. And then when the pitch is thrown, I'll run to center field. Does it work? Yeah, it totally works. Just so he can see movement in his eyes and it gets a little confusing. But I only do that with the really good hitters because they overthink it. Uh huh. I don't know. Is that stupid? No, it's not stupid at all. Makes a bunch of sense. Yeah. I like to do that. Okay. Physics question. I have a few of those while we're out here. Okay. In softball. Sometimes you'll see those players who will almost swing down through the plane of contact. Like chopping it. Like chopping wood. Yeah. Yeah. Like chopping wood. I got a 45 degree angle. Yeah. And when that happens, if the ball goes in the air, it follows this odd kind of upward and then almost spin back toward the plate kind of behavior. It has this weird glide to it. What is it about that spin being applied to the ball, that kind of goofy underspin? The back spin. Yeah. That makes it levitated. Seems like it floats longer and the Magnus effect. The what the Magnus effect. I knew you'd know the name. So the Magnus effect. So if you think about this, throw me a curve ball one second. It would be my great honor to throw you a curve ball. Yeah. Throw a curve. Okay. We're a little too close, but I think I can get a little give you some more distance. One little bit of spin on this. What's the distance between the pitcher and the catcher? It is 60 feet, six inch. Oh, pitcher in the plate is 60 feet, six inches. Oh, wow. I missed that bad. Okay. But if you stretch out, it's less. And so from the rubber that your foot goes on to the plate. Is that is that how you hold a curve ball? Me? Yeah. Now you have two fingers on one of the horseshoe seams. Yeah. And I'm not loose. I don't know if I can get this to spin or not. See, here's just like a, this is like a two o'clock to eight o'clock curve ball. This would be a very hitable curve ball, but it should break a little bit. Okay. A little bit of movement. Yeah. So I did the same thing. I just put a lot of spin on it. Yeah. I kind of, I'm spinning it over the top, but the way your hand releases it, it spins like at a 45 degree angle. Yeah. I tried to exaggerate the spin and it didn't work there. It's really hard for me to catch over here because I'm a backlit or you're backlit because of the sun. I'm going to move 90 degrees to the sun. Let's go in this little spot over here. Then we're near, let's get the sun. Okay. So Magnus effect. Yeah. I'll give you more of a breaking ball later on. Okay. So what I find is that if I try to throw a curve ball before I'm loose, it looks like what you just did where you get a little curve, but you have to do that you're almost like you're flexing your muscle. You're flicking it. Yeah. And that is not sustainable for joints and ligaments that'll wreck you. Yeah. You played college baseball, didn't you? I did. I did not throw a knuckle ball. Dude, that was pretty good. Good enough that I didn't see it come and I dropped it. Nice toss. Oh, that was ugly and weird. Isn't it weird? The knuckle ball went, they like rotated it a weird way. I mean, so a knuckle ball for the third chair, because I can't see us playing catch, is when you try to take all the spin off of a baseball. Yeah. Which is not feel natural because the way that the pads in your fingers grab the seams of the ball, the motion of throwing just naturally creates that friction on release and it gives it a bunch of spin. So you are throwing a knuckle ball with your actual knuckles, right? I am. Yeah. So I, I kind of hold it with all my fingernails and I push away from my finger as I'm throwing. Interesting. Yeah. And for me, it's just my fingernails. I'm dug into the white part of the ball. Okay, that is weird looking. I think your knuckle ball is better than mine because there's just a little bit of rotation and it's forward. It's weird. Yeah. Sometimes I'll take my pinky finger and I'll hang it off the edge to try to stabilize that. But it doesn't, it doesn't work as well. It's a good knuckle ball. I mean, you're getting the spin off of it. Golly, you're, you got a derpy kind of throw with that. That's great. That was pretty, that broke. That curved in. That was weird. I don't understand how knuckle balls break, but sometimes they do. God, I'm so uncomfortable with yours. That makes me really, really happy. It's meant to make you uncomfortable. You were talking about the Magnus effect before we moved. And why that spin makes the ball float or move different? Yes. So the way it's been explained to me is where flow is high, pressure is low. Okay. And if you think about spinning a baseball, one side of the baseball is if you imagine it rotating, like let's say you're just looking at a baseball from the side and it's flying left to right. And let's say it's rotating clockwise. Okay. The air moving across the skin of the baseball is going to go higher. It's the velocity, relative velocity is going to be higher on the advancing side. And it's going to be lower on the retreating side. So you have a dissimetry of pressure there because of the drag or the air dynamics. Any difference in pressure there at all will pull the ball in one direction. So yeah, yeah, well, that, yeah, that didn't break very well. But no, I moved. I don't know what makes it that moved. I don't know what makes it break more than other things. But I do know that one night in Lacey's spring, Alabama, was the best curveball night of my life. And for some reason, I don't know if we were closer to the river and we got better pressure differential. I don't know what happened. But I knew I could make people jump out of the box when I was pitching. And then it would come in for a strike. Really? It only happened one time. Maybe Mercury was in retrograde or something. I don't know. But it's pretty good. What about you? What do you mean? Best time ever throwing a breaking pitch? Yeah. I relied on it so much in high school and college and the knuckleball as well. Yeah, I just rarely threw a fastball or a straight pitch at all. Everything had movement on it. So I don't know if I can do it. Again, I'm not loose yet. But I had this breaking ball. Did that go the opposite way? That went the other way, didn't it? How did you do that? Isn't that weird? Is that a slider? That is a screwball. How did you do that? Or cut fastball. But I don't really throw a cut fastball. I throw a throw. How did you do that? I am closing like I'm throwing a football. That's not how you throw a football though. Well, it can't be. So rather than rotating across my body and turning my hand forward toward my opposite throwing hip. Yeah. I'm coming over my body and I am rotating my hand outward and coming back to my throwing hip. But you're having to do it violently. It doesn't hurt. It's a very, but it broke the wrong way, right? And the first time you see that a feminine motion with your hand there, but it's hurtful. Give it again. Now I miss that one. I don't like it. Yeah, one. That one slipped a little bit. I can't do it. I tried. Good snag. Thank you. Oh, I hate everything about that. Like from the what it looks like when I do it as a batter. I just don't like it, which is why you should throw it all the time. Right? It's weird. My dad and I used to play burnout. You know what that is? Where you just throw real hard and tell. Yeah. The other person cries. Golly. I could barely catch that. Because my algorithm wants to like it knows the parabola. It knows it's going from your right to my right. But then my cowman filters all messed up. It makes me when I look at my past data in my database, it makes me come across this side. That's weird. I hate it. Have you ever had a shoulder injury? So there you see that that low kind of flat slider. Yeah. That moves the same amount the other way away from the hitter. Yeah. So if you throw that. Oh, it's a disaster. Never gone. You're never getting that back. It's gone. I think it's in a lake. No, it's in the gum tree. The stakes made. Got it. What I was trying to show you before I threw that ball to eternity. Yeah. Is that how I compensated for not throwing a super hot fastball? Yeah. Just move it this way. Move it this way. Mix it up with a knuckle ball and I wonder what this sounds dumb to not take us out of the moment. But I wonder what this sounds like. Because as I'm throwing, you can probably hear me throwing when I. The exertion you mean? So again? The exertion you mean? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Especially if we make an asymmetry of the audio file here. There's that. But then I think there's the other thing where I got a little grunt going on. That's interesting. So obviously throwing a baseball just means something. Okay. Right. It is a unique social activity. I think it's different than throwing a football or playing shuffle board or hitting the tennis ball. Because the antennas eventually the idea is I want you to miss. Here, I don't want you to miss. I want to deliver something I had to you faster than I could walk it over to you. It's cooperative. Yeah. And it's kind of about getting in sync on a thing. But it's also kind of a metaphor, I think, for conversation. I think there's a reason. The dads and sons, dads and daughters, moms and daughters even, and friends. We'll just without thinking about it, go out and just pick up a ball and start throwing it back and forth like this while you shoot the breeze. Yep. This is kind of how conversation is. Oh, you're saying throw the ball back and forth. That kind of thing. Huh. Yeah. Feels right. I miss doing this with my dad. We don't do it much anymore. It's been a while. Yeah. I haven't thrown him with my dad in a while either. You used to though when you were a kid? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Dad was always assistant coach. Yeah. Which is the way. I mean, that's the way to coach. Well, yeah, you're not wrong. If you're assistant coach, you don't have to deal with the parents. Uh huh. You just get to play ball of the kids. Yeah, you're not wrong. So what was it like throwing with your dad? I mean, talk about the world or just were you trying to get better at baseball when you played catch? Mostly baseball. Yeah. Um, he'd teach me all kinds of stuff like, uh, teach me how not to be scared of it. They're you a grounder like this. We're a forest. Yeah. Have to do the alligator. The thing that we always would focus on is perfection. Maybe not perfection, but, uh, nice scoop. Like the goal is for you not to move at all. And for it to hit you right in the chat shot, you throw it well. They really got a good release. You look good. So that was, uh, the way he taught me how to throw was yeah, I threw that one low, but the goal is to never make that person move. And so we had a game where we would keep our feet like this. Okay, I'm doing it. Oh, you could you didn't have to take a walk. Feed it, move it. That one. Whatever. All right. I got to hit that. You got to hit that. It's pretty good. Yeah, not quite hitting it. Yeah, I miss that stuff. I used to stay up real late with my dad. We'd talk about things at night and go out in the yard and play catch during the day. That was a busy guy. I mean, he had a lot of responsibilities, but he was a sucker for me walking into his office with two gloves. But dad could throw it around for a minute and pretty much always he ditches stuff. That was the trump card. Yeah, right there on the spot. Your kid wants to play catch with you. You say yes, right? Yeah. I hope my son remembers that the same way. Interesting. Yeah, I need to keep saying yes. So he keeps asking my son that well, that was a disaster. Sorry, I kept it out of my crotch. That was my son. They called him up to the mound this year, which is really cool because oh, that was weird. That moved up and down knuckleball. So my son started the season in right field and then he was just consistent and they eventually let him pitch like not as a position pitcher. They actually put him in his picture a couple of times and then yeah, a couple of times he just they needed an extra few throws and they put him in there. But he worked his way all the way all the way up. It's pretty cool. So we went and sat up late one night, got some lights and started started throwing on, you know, that will sit on the bucket, hit me in the glove kind of thing. Pretty cool. Yeah, I don't know what it is. I don't know why I don't feel it over basketball or tennis or foot. I mean, I like all the sports. I play all the sports. But only baseball feels like father's son magic. Like, uh, they get breaks down whatever little invisible masculine conversational hurdle might exist. And all of a sudden, maybe just how you throw it back and forth is part of the conversation. I don't know. I might be stretching. What do you want me? I mean, sounds like you kind of want that conversation right now. Do you want me to? Are you getting some hair in places you weren't really expecting hair, son? Yes, sir. I mean, I don't know what you want me to do, buddy. I'm glad I could make you uncomfortable by talking about masculine friendship. Here's a bizarre knuckleball to mess with your sense of reality. You can throw heat, throw heat. Let me see what you got. That was a knuckleball too. It was. Okay. So I just, one second, one second, drop my glass. I will not throw hard without telling you what's coming. Okay. This is just a straight four seam standard issue ball. Yes, pretty quick. No. So my problem is, is this heat? Oh, there it is. I tried to make it cut a little bit and all I cut was dirt. Did I ever tell you about, uh, my dad's uncle, uncle pod, uncle pod couldn't talk really well. Okay. If you would, this is a great story. I'm going to get my dad to tell this story, but, uh, uncle pod. That was a disaster. He's my bad. So basically, he would say, come on, come on, hit it, win hard. You know, he was the way he talked. He was like, had a speech impediment. Okay. And he, he would tell you, my bad. He would tell you to hit a bitter weed cutter. Come at it. Bit of weed, taught him. Bit of weed, taught. What does that mean? A bitter weed cutter. So if it's really low like this, oh, that hit a log, it did, but or a worm burner, there's the same thing. Oh, I heard that. Yeah. Worm burner, worm burner. And, uh, we got to go ask my dad because they were playing out in the country after church one day or something like that. And like the community would get out there and they, the uncle, uncle pod paid played third base. I imagine this to be like back in the sixties or whatever. And they said that a crazy fast one got hit in the third base. You know, that's where you get the, the heaters or a hot corner hitting real hard. Here comes boom. And right before it got to him, it hit a little clotted dirt or a, probably a, you know, a little cow paddy or something. And it popped up and I hit uncle pod in the throat and he dropped his glove. He just threw his glove down and then he just ran off the field and he went to the concession stand and he got a Coke and he started golfing it. And they're like, what are you doing, uncle pod? He goes, I got hit in the doozle. I got to get me a dank before my doozle, swallow. He got hit in the goozle. He said, I got hit in the goozle. I got to get me a dank before my doozle, swore up. I'm not going to lie, I was hoping the punchline of the story would be it knocked the speech impediment right out of him or back into him. Yeah, kind of like a rookie of the year or something. He had a British accent. Yeah. No, that was not the case. But I'm getting dead to tell that story. It's pretty good. But we always talk about getting hit in the doozle. You want to try to get to 100? What are we getting to 100 at? One, two, three. You want to go quick hands? Four, no. Five, six. Good thing that's a 14-inch glove you got there. Eight, and here's a 14. What is that? Riveting radio. No, it's not. That's what it is. 15, 16, 17. What happened there? 18. You see me drop it and recover it in the process of throwing? 20. I mean, the throw is there. It just didn't go on the right side of the body now. I'm starting to sweat. Nice. That means it's working. Everyone's going to do this with a kid. I do this. I just make one that's a little harder. Fortunately, fortunately I can't prepare it. Oh, what the heck is that? You said you were trying to make it harder for a second. What are we at? 99. I think that's like 75. Oh, gosh. You ever see that little meme or whatever? It's been floating around for a while. Shows a bunch of kids with their ball gloves and everything. It says, one day in your childhood, you went out to play with all your friends, and it was the last time and nobody knew. You see that one? Yeah. It sucked. You think? Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? Doing what? Why are you making this sad? Why is that sad? I don't know. You're only kids for so long. I guess this is what I'm doing. Okay. Well, first of all, I think that meme is true. Obviously, there was a last time. You're just not thinking that way when you're a kid about the whole crew, the whole gang, and everything. So that said, I guess what I never understood about that is why we stopped. Right? Should we go play kickball? No, I don't want to play kickball with you. So that gets back to the first question you asked me the last time I did it was. Yeah, that's it. I see what we're doing here. I see what's going on. It's because of responsibility. How do you mean? You got to go feed people that need you to feed them. Well, first you have to go make them. I don't know. It just feels like it kind of gets time to not play anymore. Yeah. If you got a quick plan and you got to go accomplish something, and that's good. I like accomplishing things, but I guess I kind of feel like we were accomplishing things when we went out and played catch. Played ball in the neighbor's yard or whatever. I think that was fruitful. I don't think that was just frivolous rehearsing for something that would matter later on. I think that all of that play mattered then. I think how we treated each other then mattered then. Did you have that kid in your neighborhood that was like, they weren't super fun to play with, but you invited them anyway? Yeah, we did. Or literally everybody else is busy, but well, that kid's available. Yeah. That kid? Yeah. Yeah. That kid. Yeah. I think I might have been that kid. I might have been that kid too. Totally get it. I guess it's what I'm driving at. It makes me sad that this sometimes I think of play as a thing that is the opposite of work or recovery from work and not accomplishing anything because I think we're accomplishing something right now. And I don't care if I can't tell you exactly what it is. I don't know. For whatever reason, for me, it's meaningful to hang out with my friends and not have anything electronic around us. And something as simple as what my dad and his friends did, his dad and his friends did. It was just being a part of something incredibly simple and that you can't do by yourself. By playing catch, it's just kind of, it's sort of the anti-digital in a way, you know? Yes. And play for the sake of play because, I don't know, because you got a friend. It's a good thing to have a friend. It's a good thing to have a dad. And it's a good thing to play. So if that friend has to get on an airplane and come to Alabama, you came to me last time. It evens out. This episode of Notre Dame Questions is sponsored by Raycon. Really good earbuds. Absolutely. They're fantastic. Yeah. I like the blue ones. Yeah. There's the ones I wear. The blue ones sound a little different than those white ones. In my head. Okay. To me, they sound exactly the same as my white ones. Sounds sportier to me. I don't know. A little quicker. I don't know what to do. A little faster. I had the blue ones on when I flew down here to hang out with you. And I had an awareness mode on when I got on the plane. I could hear all of the announcements and everything going on. Then I thought, you know, I didn't get my sleep last time. It's time for me to shut it down. So I put on a real boring talk show. Yeah. And I took off awareness mode and everything just went away. That's great. And those people talking about stocks and bonds and other things I don't understand. They just put me straight to sleep. When I woke up, I was in Alabama. So true story. Yeah. I was on an airplane recently. Two guys behind me talking real loud. Okay. I looked at the guy right to me to my right. I was near the window. We were on the left side of the airplane looked at my right and I was like, like kind of like gave him the look like, are you hearing this? Can you believe they're talking like this? This guy starts talking about all kinds of stuff about time he had in the army, all this stuff. He starts talking about learning English and learning German in Germany. Basically, Germans who learn English and people from America who learn German while they're in Germany. He's talking about all this stuff. Sure. He's like, yeah, man, there's some Germans. You don't want them learning English. I was like, what? Who's like, what does it mean? He's like, yeah. Yeah, those people. And I was like, what is happening? Where am I? Where am I flying into? I was just, he was just singling out a people group and like saying, yeah, you don't want them to have this language. And I was like, what does this even mean? So we get ready to get off the plane and me and the guy next to me, we both put in our earbuds and we were like just trying to drown out what they were doing, which awareness mode off right on the earbuds got off the plane and I'm like, hey, dude, I don't know what that was. And I heard him talk and he had kind of a South African twang to his voice. I was like, are you South African? He goes, no, no, I'm German. So the guys behind me were talking about Germans and he was German. He was just playing along really nice. Oh, I get it now. So it was interesting. What about his earbuds? Were they high quality Raycon earbuds or were they a lesser brand? I think they were a lesser brand. That's okay. Yeah, it's okay. Traveling far from home. It probably had to buy something that's cut rate, but still very expensive from some airport store where they overcharge when he could have just gone to by Raycon.com slash NDQ. So it's your thing. That's the one. Yeah. Yeah. What's going to be your stand for again? What's the name of this program? No, no questions. Yeah. A couple of things that I think we both like about Raycons. One is you get the gel tips so they super fit in your ears and they're not going anywhere. That is a total dad thing to say. Oh, yeah. It's not going anywhere. Yeah. Okay. I did that. But that's the thing. Ratchet straps and Raycon gel tips that's not going anywhere. You know it's true. Yeah. I say it every time I do that.

I wonder if we're getting close to a hundred. We haven't dropped anything, have we? Oh, we dropped a couple. Not since we started like counting. Right. Do you remember that time we went to the beach and we started playing paddleboard or what was that called? The yeah, I actually had a surgery after that and lost a testicle. So I remember it vividly. You didn't. But I did. No, I didn't. But I could argue. You hit me really hard. But that was the first time we had done something like that. And do you remember? I well, let me put this way. I remember your face because I remember your face because it said, oh, you're not supposed to have these skills, but you do. Oh, yeah, because you were competent? No, yeah, just remember, I remember your face. You're like, Oh, you're used to throwing with people that can't throw back. You're using the hitting of paddle with people that can't hit back. And I'm just, I remember that. I remember thinking, I've seen I've seen my son and his buddies. Like he's got a buddy. I went to camp with him recently. And I remember him discovering that the other kid was good at stuff. And then they just kind of gravitated to each other and like, Oh, I can play ball with this kid literally. I remember, I remember seeing that and being like, Oh, that's fun. The moment that I realized that you were athletically competent. Is that it worked? Yeah, whatever. Just I could catch. Well, yeah. And throw it back. Yeah. And really, I mean, we sat out there on the beach and just tried to see how many times we could keep that paddle ball in the air. There was a lot. You bailed us out there. I got dangerously close to the dirt. Yeah, I didn't catch it. I caught it right in the palm though. I'm not proud of that. Man, I wonder what number we're at. Third chair knows. Yeah, I don't. We haven't dropped any will. We'll make sure to spell it out when one hits the dirt so they can let us know when we fail. Yeah, man. I don't know what it is. Like the dad thing or state of the world or what, but I have been enjoying simple things like this a lot more last I don't couple of years. I don't keep up with politics much anymore. I I'm working on a fence at home. Same. I'm gonna I'm gonna keep a goat in there. That's kind of the opposite of politics. Like I just want to go that can be like, Hey goat. You want to eat this? Goats eat cans according to cartoons, right? And gloves. Gloves are their favorite food. Yeah. That's what I learned in cartoons. I mean, my thought is, I don't know, I just the less I get on the internet and the less I read social media, the happier I become. Are you doing that less? Yeah. I am. Why? Uh, I think I'm doing that less because I realize there's not like a single tweet I'm going to read or post or whatever they call it these days. It's like I'm waiting for the one thing to read. They're like, Oh, cool. Well, that was it. That's the one I was looking for. I guess I don't have to read social media anymore because I finally satisfied that internal thirst for whatever it is I'm looking for. That's not going to happen. No, it's not there. Ever. Why did it had that occur to you? I don't know. I mean, I've had this thought many times and I was posting a lot too. I just don't post as much anymore in terms of tweets or I don't know it when I do I try to make it constructive. All right, we go 10 throws real real tight one. Two. I got blinded there for a sec. What's that? I just got the wrong backdrop for the ball for one second. It took me a minute to pick it back up. I did that a minute ago too. You get a bright leaf behind it. The contrast isn't there. Here's last one and there's a lobber for 10. That was nice. Way to call for the vigorous interlude. So I don't know. I just don't think I want to spend as much time on social media. But I do want to spend more time doing things with my hands. I like tractors. I like turning rinsches like making things. Yeah, well, you used to make things a lot. Now you make things even more. Learn more tools and stuff to do that. That's a direct threat to your social media time. It is. Yeah. I think getting the social media time down to toilet time only is about perfect. Toilet time. That's plenty. Only. Wow. I must admit, I reached up in the shower too. The interesting. Yeah. My phone's water. Oh. Oh, wow. I didn't think it was as short as you thought I was. Yeah. I kind of messed that one up. I'm going to give you a real safe one. That was safe. Thanks. That's the safest throw of my life. That was safe like a sitcom dad throwing toward the camera knowing no one is going to be on the other side to catch it. Yeah. Having to look super gentle with his eyebrows up in the middle. There you go, junior. Great job. Your mom and I are so proud of you. But there are some tough lessons we have to learn today about integrity. Isn't that right, champ? It was that kind of throw. Yeah. I don't think I don't think the schedule for middle of life assessment stuff kind of works the way it used to. But I more feel like I'm in the middle of the part of my life that is going to be involved with technology and the internet deeply. And I'm definitely assessing how much of my time I want to go there. My brother died years ago now. I was 20 early twenties when he died. And we play games together. We spend a lot of our time together doing stuff like this, you know, wrestling around sports, whatnot. We play video games and we like role play games like Final Fantasy stuff like that. You make a team of characters, you go fight their goblins and whatever. And I still have always save files for back then. You still do? Yeah, I still have them. Yeah. On what? On the original cartridges? NES. SNES and PlayStation and like the first one. Really? Memory cards and everything still. And I've pulled them back out. And there we are right where we left it. Right where he and I left it just before just for the accident. And it's cool to be like, hey, now this is the last thing that my brother saw in this fake imaginary world with me when we were playing this together. Of course, there's always two characters. One's a mat, one's a mark. So there we are all decked out with the weapons and armor and helmets and everything else that we both thought would be the right one for each of us to be wearing in that scenario. And so our decisions are still there in Shrind and ones and zeros and our unpacking of a journey, a story, a quest together is still there in Shrind and ones and zeros. I haven't finished it. I haven't touched the main character moved around at all. I'm just leaving it right there. Are there two characters? What game are we talking about? This would be Final Fantasy 3 was the one we were playing at that point. So there are, I don't know, 20 characters, but you make a little party out of the four you like the best. I don't know. It's just have you taken a picture of it? Huh. No, you know, I suppose I have it. I think those were on a battery backup. I probably should snap a picture of that. But the point is, it's cool that there's some ones and zeros left behind by him. That's cool. But it's not anywhere close to what I cherish the most. And in the end, when I look at those, I feel a little bit of connectedness with him, but I feel like, huh, it'd be a pity if your whole legacy was this. Save files, ones, zeros, things with file extension names. What do you mean? I mean, I want a smaller percentage of whatever I leave behind someday to be save files. And I want a bigger sense or a bigger percentage to be tangible, a bigger percentage to be things we built, ball gloves that we broke in, baseballs we scuffed up. It's all going to burn though. It's all going to burn. Sure. Sure. So is that your attitude on it? No, I mean, what I mean by that is the things that do last your relationships. Little risky throwing knuckle balls this deep into the, we haven't dropped it streak we got going on. You dog, you know what? What if I just throw it fast? Make you, oh, the Willie May's action there. There you go. Okay. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. You know what I just did for us? Do you know what I just did for us? I do. Yeah. I mean, that was a full retreat from you with my back to you just so you could make a point. My knuckle ball was to you. That was an act of aggression. And now you're going to get an act of aggression. And you're not going to watch it. Yeah. No, you're not. You're going to get another sick come dad throw. What were you saying about stuff burning? Like our street? I think it's all going to burn. And I think the relationship stuff is actually going to last. My opinion. I don't know that the save file is just a one is or zero left behind. That was a little time that you and Mark had together. Yeah. That was super fun. So I, I think it lasts beyond the, we, we moved into a house one time, somebody that had died. Okay. And their family member was cleaning up. And they had some stuff there. They were trying to figure out what to do with it. It was like an old dog's collar. Right? Okay. So this individual's dog had died. And the family was coming in and they were like, man, this is overwhelming. Like, what do you do with this? It's a dog collar of like this really good dog this person had. And the person was keeping the collar to remember the dog. The person had died. And now the memory of that dog only existed in the family member's mind. Right. Once they thought through the dog collar away, it's gone. Right. Except in memory. Right. So what do you do? Do you throw the dog collar away? Yeah. You do. Yeah, it was low. I'm sorry. No, you don't need to apologize. Just so just wanted to show you that I'm committed and I'm making the effort. I guess my point is we're yeah, I got to bring that up. I don't know what you're doing. No, you're fine. So I guess the point is like my calculus notebooks from college right in the house there. I don't know. It's cool to look back at my, my mom's elementary school crayon drawings, which we have some of. But like, I don't know. Yeah, I think some of is kind of the key there. Right. I've got a lot more save files from my brother from school or projects or whatever. I'm not going through all of those. Just, you know, that save file is particularly special. I had a little bend to it. Did you pull twisty twist on that one now? That was weird. It got lucky. You know, okay. Maybe it was an optical collision. I still have some of his clothes. Do you wear them? No. No. Too weird. No. It just, I don't know. I don't even really think of them as being the kind of thing I would wear. It just doesn't cross my mind. It's not the ultimate thing to do with heirloams like that. What's that? Pass them on to somebody else and say these are really important and Mark would have wanted you to have this. Oh, that way now they have to do it. Oh, wherever he would have wanted that. Do you know how I know? Because I just said it. Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Is it your brother who died? Then hold on to this shirt. Monster. Yeah. What do you say when somebody says, hey, this is, this is your Aunt Bessie's. Okay. This was her favorite piano bench. We just knew you'd want it. It'll go well with all your Ikea furniture. You got me tagged. So, I don't know. I mean, that's why I say it's all going to burn. Yeah. I hear you. It's been fun trying to think about how to, and you say relationship is what you get to keep. I agree. So, in this mortal physical world, what can you do to preserve that without crossing the lines of like being weird and creepy and having your legacy dictate terms to people in the future out of some misguided sense of guilt and grief. And I've been thinking about that stuff that I've been doing. I told you about the skip and rock bucket, right? Nope. Really? Nope. Oh, I made a skip and rock bucket. Okay. Yeah, I was skipping rocks a few years ago. Found some really good ones. I threw them out into the lake. I thought, well, now that's over. And it's spent and I already know how to skip rocks fairly well. What if I started saving some of these good ones that I find or if I find one when I'm not near water, save it? So, I got a bunch of them in my garage. There's a bucket. It's a skip and rock bucket. And from all over the world, just great rocks that need to be skipped someday. In the skip and rock bucket goes a USB drive with a little letter and the bucket is labeled, do not throw away ever. And it's just clearly marked, give this to the first generation of kids after I'm gone. What is it? It's just a video me saying, maybe we met, maybe we didn't, either way. I think skipping rocks is really fun. I knew someday there would be a you. So, over the course of my life, I've collected these good skipping rocks from all around the world. There's plenty. So you can keep trying. It doesn't matter if they don't all skip. Here's how you do it. This is my favorite set of techniques. If you do it like this, you get this. If you do it like this, you get this. And I hope you have fun skipping rocks. That's it. No big, sappy, sad speech or anything. I just want to teach one generation of my descendants something that isn't handed down indirectly, but directly from me to you, I taught you one thing, how to skip rocks. And I thought of you in advance because I had to get the rocks in advance. So, something more about the sappy thing you don't want to say in that message. What do you mean? You said not some sappy, whatever message. Tell me more about that sappy message that you don't want it to be. I mean, I kind of hinted at it a minute ago. When I'm gone, I don't want that to be one of those patriarch legacies where it's like dad never would have wanted us to do this or always wanted us to do that out of misguided obligation to dad's memory. We have to do these things that don't really make sense given how the world is now. I don't want that. I don't want to heap stuff on them. Yeah, so I don't want to do a whole thing about how all the things ought to be. I hope the stuff that I believe and what I tried to hand down. I hope that stuff goes through my kids to future generations. I hope that what comes from me directly is just the rock skipping. Maybe a couple other lessons too when I think of them, but for now that's what I've been thinking of. Because the video I made, it's on a DVD in the safety deposit box. Well, who's that video for? For my family? Who know you? There's also a video in there that's for people that don't know me. Really? Yeah, made it in 2012. Okay, which was a hard year. Why? Because I was going to Africa and I thought there was a good chance I could die. Why were you? What? Lots of people go to Africa and die at all. Every single African who is there right now and alive didn't die in Africa. This was a hard trek. I did some some travel over land and places I never been. I was like, ah, I don't know. Okay, you're feeling stuff. I was feeling it. So I made a video. I need to go revisit that. But yeah, I made a video talking about talking about how I think things are and how I was feeling thing. I don't know. I need to go watch it. I don't even remember what's on it. You're not going to replace it. Are you? I might. Really? Maybe. Why not just add to it? Just make a new one? Yeah, I could add to it, but people change. Right. But that was still you. And that's a cross section of what you were lined up with that moment in history. Yeah. And if we give past versions of ourselves and people from the past the benefit of the doubt, we assume they were trying to do things that made sense given how their world was in that moment. And so it might be a little cringy at moments because the world has changed. And now things you said that were clever or original look played out and tired here there. But it's still a nice sample of who you were and where it was at. And that could be really encouraging to future generations when they are that age or they are in a moment in history that kind of rhymes with 2012, you know, yeah, but adding to it just gives them another sample from another part of yeah, your process. Now I wouldn't watch it. I wouldn't swap it. I have to watch it. I don't know. I guess there are certain things that I suppose a person could say in a video where I'd recommend you swap it. I'm just guessing you didn't. I've also got a video game cartridge preloaded with the worst weapons build out I could imagine to make things harder for the next generation. That's a joke. I didn't do that. Oh, I was like, I really like this idea. No, it's interesting. You should go play that game sometime. Yeah, maybe just finish it out, huh? Or how many do you have? How many games do you have? I have two that we distinctively invested in. We got original version of Chrono Trigger and we got Final Fantasy 3. Those were the two we that were in the rotation when he told me about the Chrono Trigger one. Maybe I did. Huh. I wonder if there's a way to clone that game. I don't know. Like you put the cartridge in and you you make an image of that. I mean, there are multiple saved slots. I could probably just keep playing and save it to another save file. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's really interesting. I don't know, dude. It's just playing catch. It's just throwing a ball back and forth. But every time I ever have the chance to do this with friends, people I care about, seems like your head goes to a different place than other circumstances for conversation. And I'm grateful when I really like people I play catch with them. Yeah. I feel the same way. Sweet. We're uh, I don't think we're ever going to drop one. Yeah, that's a thing. I can do this all day. I could too. Dead gummy. That's a ground ball. It doesn't count. It's got to be a legit drop. There. Dead gummy. You dropped it. Yeah, that was a problem because we weren't going to do it, where are we? No, I wasn't going to drop that. No, it's official. We're done. That ball hit the ground. All right. Let me find my glasses. I did a thing. Oh, great. I just laid them right here in the poison ivy. Just put those on your eyes. It's going to be wonderful. The bridge of your nose. Thank you very much.
