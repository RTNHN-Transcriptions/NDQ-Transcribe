It looks like it is not performing at the same rate as most of your videos, but when you really dive into something, that's kind of how it works. Is that a fair read on the performance? Yes, the YouTube algorithm, I've decided to not care about it. Like, I've decided that I'm going to do the things that I love and I'm going to just let the internet sort it out because I know the YouTube algorithm is, I don't know, I've decided not to care anymore. I really like that mentality and I'm arriving at the same place, as you know, over on the content that I make. Yeah, I mean, I'm feeling like too much of my happiness and I for learning is starting to be informed by the machine learning algorithm at YouTube. And I don't want that to shape my thought. I want to investigate the things I want to investigate, have the conversations I want to have and whatever is whatever. Yeah, I've decided I'm going to study what I like and, you know, I know things that'll go viral on YouTube and I don't want to let that inform what I make. 100%. So I think more content will exist if I make the things that I'm interested in and I'm doing the same thing. And what you are interested in, at least in part, is flight and space. I mean, that's always been your bag. And so this video you just put out is about one narrow little part of what I imagine has to be a much larger equation. And that is how do we get from some people in caveman clothes with like those really big sticks that look like Cheetos that you can club animals with? How do we go from that to walking around on the moon? And this video that you just made isn't about all of the stages of evolution and figuring out all of that technology. This is just about the part where you go from being in the spaceship in orbit at the moon to down on the surface without breaking anything. Am I hearing you right? Absolutely. So how to land on the moon, not how to go to the moon and how like how we put a person on the moon with a big rocket, like assuming you're in orbit around the moon. How do you go from that orbit down to the ground? I've always just kind of like hand wave that is like, oh, well, of course you use a rocket and you just like right before you hit the ground and you like little harder, you know, sure. It is way more complicated than that. And specifically the question I want to ask is how did humans train to do that in the 60s in one G Earth's gravity, nine point eight meters per second squared? How do they train to do it here? When on the moon you have one sixth G, one point six to five meters per second square. So like spacecraft and aircraft behave differently in those two gravitational regimes. And I wanted to figure out how they solve that problem. It would be like me figuring out how to sail a boat in a gigantic squall while practicing while wearing shoes and walking around in calm conditions on a tennis court. They're basically the same. That's the best metaphor I've ever heard, Matt. But you see what I'm saying, right? They're completely different conditions and I can simulate like, well, I point my forward direction this way and then I cut it this way, but I'm not in water. How am I going to know what it actually feels like when I'm actually in the water? Yeah. And there's only one way to do that. And that's practice, but the problem is you can't practice on earth in one G for something that's in one six G because you don't have a take away five, six, the G's o meter thing. Yeah, it doesn't sound like a thing. No, I want to I want to process what I saw in your video. I got more questions. I want to see if I can do the thing where I use your brain to understand something I would never otherwise understand. You down with that? Yep. Let's do it. All right. Okay, so here's where I want to start. If earth has one G and the moon has one sixth G, there's a difference there of how many G's five, six, the VIG. That's right. Five, six, the VIG. So back in the sixties, the Apollo engineers had this problem. They had to figure out how to build something that could fly, but they had to be able to take five, six of the weight away from it. Which is pretty difficult. Does that make you with me? Mm hmm. Okay. So here's what they did. They started by trying a helicopter, but then they realized there were some issues about how a helicopter flew around. It's hard to explain on the podcast format, but basically imagine this. If we had a helicopter, it can hover, right? Sure. And so the lift is equal to the weight of the helicopter. But if you tilt forward, you've got all that lift force pushing down. If you tilt forward just a little bit, you're going to fly forward really, really fast because that horizontal component of that lift is going to push you, right? Can you see that? Mm hmm. See a little triangle in your head. There wolf. Sure. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you tilt over and you go. Yeah. But if you're on the moon and you have one sixth G, you don't need that much lift. So your rocket that you would use on the moon to push down, it's like a sixth as powerful. Sixteen point six percent is powerful. So if you were to tilt over at the same amount, you wouldn't go forward real fast like air wolf. You would just kind of float real like, I don't know, like you can kind of see more, more like a, uh, what are the gymnastic ribbon baton people or whatever? You know, it kind of it's more floaty. Rhythm and ribbons. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. So that that was the problem with a helicopter. They, they couldn't match the amount of angle you had to tilt over in order to translate back and forth on the moon. So then they went to this thing called the X 14, which is a vertical takeoff and landing airplane that existed in the sixties, which blew my mind because I didn't know they had that, which is incredible. Um, you know what though? When I picture the way a VTL unit like that moves, I do picture kind of the thing you're just describing that almost ethereal, drippy, gelic point eight, three and change gravity ratio kind of movement. Yeah. More like a jellyfish. So unless like a tuna, yeah, there you go. There you go. Good. Yeah. Exactly. And that's what I thought. But, um, Neil Armstrong said that the X 14 VTOL aircraft just didn't do what it needed to do. It was like straight up and straight down as well. It was good at it. It couldn't drift around at that high angle of bank. All right. So picture in GI Joe and true lies or whatever the Schwarzenegger movie is where they fight on the bridge against a, like a Harrier or something like that. So I'm picturing fantasy stuff straight up. Yeah. Okay. So that didn't work. The next idea was, Hey, let's make a little lunar lander and let's put a cable on top of it and let's just put five, six of the weight and just pull it up, right? And then you can kind of do the drifty thing. And that kind of worked actually, like they did a pretty good job of simulating. Like it, do you have this in your mind's eye? Like they, they lift it up by a cable like connected on top of the lander. And then you could use these little pop thrusters to offset the other one, six to G and you could also tilt over and stuff like that. And it kind of behaved as if it was on the moon. That's what I would have intuited. Yeah. If you'd, if you'd asked me in advance to picture how you would do that, I imagined a series of cables and a frame system and maybe permanently, I imagined, sorry, this is embarrassing. But I'm going to do it anyway. Like people holding the cables, like almost blayers who work together, like a Cirque du Soleil performance and pull and they released to simulate, to create that simulation using each other's strength and tension working against each other at slightly different ratios to, to give it the field that you'd want. And that's a silly way to explain it. But I think you get what I'm saying. No, that's not silly at all. That's exactly what they did except they used hydraulic and electronics, you know, hydraulic systems in order to do that. They, they created this thing called the LLRF, the lunar lander research facility. It was a gigantic trust structure with like a moving crane up top that would always stay above the lander, but the person inside the lander could actually control it. So it was like a mate is kind of like a puppet. You've seen these people on the street that have a little puppet dangling from strings. Yeah, sure. It's like that, but the puppets controlling itself is kind of how they did it. It's amazing. So that was pretty good, but it was only a certain size. And then ultimately they ended up with two things, the lunar lander research vehicle and the lunar lander training vehicle. And this was something completely different. Imagine a bed frame with a jet engine right in the center, pointing straight up. At all times. Who can imagine that? My wife. Exactly. All right. There you go. So, so that's how that worked. And, uh, but the cool thing about it is as the bed frame would fly up, just when you go, whoa, you know, fire up the jet and it just hovers off the ground. As you tilt this thing over in space with these pop thrusters, the jet engine would stay pointed straight up and it was always pushing up at five sixth. The, the weight of the vehicle, right? Mm hmm. And so once they did that, they could use hydrogen peroxide pop thrusters and attitude control systems in order to fly the thing around in that droopy little one G. This is the training vehicle. Yeah. Exactly. They, in one G, they could simulate one sixth G by taking five sixth of the weight off with a jet engine running straight through the middle the whole time. It's crazy, but imagine balancing that, right? So imagine having a jet engine, holding it underneath something and having to balance it. It's like balancing a broomstick in your palm of your hand, right? You're okay. So if I, oh, I just dropped my phone. That's really disappointing. That's a very difficult exercise to take. Explain what you're doing. Okay. I have my cell phone here. I've got it glass down and I am trying to balance my phone on my vertically oriented pointer finger and just keep it under control. And I'm trying to like move it around. Like I'm, I'm doing this whole weird balance. I'm going to drop it again where I'm like sliding my hand forward quickly and backwards and doing this quick control because I feel the weight and the momentum of the tilt at the outer edges of my phone trying to get away from me. And so I'm quickly moving my pointer finger forward to correct for that, which then creates a problem behind. So it's like spinning a basketball on my finger, except I don't get the luxury of that centrifugal force to keep it centered. I risk up it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I understand why this is challenging. Yeah. Exactly. And so that's, that's what the video was about. Like how do you land on the moon? Cause first of all, you have to practice in a one sixth G environment. And so, so here's what I'd like to do now. Now that you see how they practiced and that's a challenging problem, do you know how to activate your thrusters in order to land on the moon? Have you ever thought through like we're in lunar orbit, we're going to go down the surface. Have you thought through that exercise? No, we tried to do this conversation on a zoom call in my new little sound studio. It took me 35 minutes to engineer plugging in a USB cable so that you could hear me. No, I have not thought about how to use a mono rocket rectangular octave. A diagonal landing unit to put it on the moon. No, no, I certainly haven't, but I'm excited to. Let's figure that out. Let's do it. Okay. Hey, everybody. This episode of note on questions is brought to you by Raycon. They make earbuds that both of us use every day. This is an everyday pocket item for me. I got a little multi tool I put in my pocket. I got a phone that has a couple of my driver's license and my credit card in the back. I have a key and I got my little Raycons. That's it. That's my drag around every day thing. Yeah, they're fantastic. I've been running a whole lot lately and I use the thanks, Matt. I use the everyday E25 and I love them. My favorite thing about them is they've got this little button on them so you can pause your music, your audiobook, your podcast, whatever, just by touching the button, which is super convenient.

I love these things by Raycon.com slash indie queue, 15% off your order. What does the lander look like? Okay, so the lander they built to practice? Yeah, or just, I mean, what did the actual lander look like the first time we made it to the moon? Yeah, so imagine just a little bit of gumdrop looking thing with four legs sticking out the bottom. And the four legs are sticking out on the corners and you got a rocket right in the middle on the bottom. So grimace, but with four legs instead of two? Yes, exactly. Okay. Okay. Or a spider with four of the legs pulled off. I can't picture that. I wouldn't do something like that to a spider. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. You know what I'm saying? So if you kind of take your pinky right now and you kind of hold your pinky into the palm of your hand and you take your your four fingers and you put them down on the table or if you're in the third chair in a car, you put it down the console next to you in the vehicle, you can see those four legs and just imagine that there's a rocket shooting out of the middle of your hand between your index finger knuckle and your middle finger knuckle shooting straight down. So just one. Well, there's just one rocket that's, you know, for Apollo, that's how it went down, but they also had attitude control systems, which are little pulse thrusters all around the vehicle so that you can roll this thing around and then fire to get the most influence from that big rocket down in the middle. What are the pulse thrusters thrusting with? Is it air? Is it fuel? No, no, I don't know. I don't remember. Um, some of them use air, some reaction control systems or attitude control systems use air. Some of them use just pressurized gas. So you just have to open a valve and put a little gas out there. Some of them use like full on propellant, like a monoprop, you know, or even hydrazine or hypergolics where you take two things and you put them together. A hypergol is as soon as you take two chemicals and you shoot them together, they blow up immediately. You don't have to do anything. Just when the chemicals touch, they go boom. So there's all different ways to do this. And, uh, I don't know exactly what chemicals they used on the lunar module. I don't know. But this is the thing that I can picture from sci-fi programs, little, yep, you just see the little pups pulses. Yeah. Coming out pulses. Okay. All right. So I can picture that. So coming down, are we using the rocket as like a retro rocket to slow the descent or we only use in that rocket to get back up to orbit? Well, the first thing to think about is in your mind's eye, are you in orbit? And then you just decide to go down to the moon. Is that kind of how it looks? We've established my mind's eye is a flaming disaster that involves utter catastrophe for everyone involved. So, uh, I picture orbit and all I can picture is earth gravity. So I picture a thing going around in a circle and then we drop the other thing out and it kind of gets left behind. It looks like it's trailing behind it to the eye. No. So let's do this. Yeah. Let's ignore about all that. So just in your mind's eye, we're in orbit, me and you're in orbit. And we're only like just to make this easy. We're only like 500 feet off the ground and we're screaming, man. We're moving so fast. And you can see the moon going underneath you and you can see us going around the moon, but we're falling towards the moon, but we're moving so fast. We never actually hit it. Does that make sense? That's what orbit is. That's what orbit is. We're falling straight towards the planet, but we're moving forward so fast. We never hit it. That's orbit. OK, got it. Yeah. OK, so if that's what we're doing, how do we slow down? Where do we need to shoot our rocket? You got this. We're moving straight towards the horizon. If we need to go down towards the moon, how do we slow down? Which direction do we shoot our rocket in forward? Exactly. Yeah, you shoot it in front of you and you go and you shoot it straight in front of you and that starts to slow you down. How about that? When it starts to slow you down, that's going to make it where, oh, I'm going to hit the moon now, but I'm going to hit it where way out there on the horizon. Right, right? Yep. I don't want to hit. I don't want to hit the moon, man. I want to gently touch down on the moon. So what I do is I keep that rocket pointing whichever way I'm flying, whichever direction I'm flying, that's where I shoot the rocket. How about that? Yeah. I think in my brain, this was like an Atari level graphics exercise where I'm picturing a lunar lander that's almost more like a space elevator, a disconnected space elevator that just goes up and down to the actual spacecraft. And you're right, that doesn't make any sense at all. Doesn't work. This is more complicated than I thought and I thought it was complicated. Dang. Okay. So you're firing the lunar lander crown forward. No, no, no, no, if we were sitting in the thing, the legs are going to be pointing towards the horizon. You know, you got your little hand thing. Okay. So it's like you're holding your hand out, you're reaching out to the horizon and you're firing straight in the direction of travel. So our head's grimaces showing his undercarriage to the horizon. Exactly. And his BD eyes are back there toward the ship. Yeah, exactly. Okay. And so that's what we're doing. We're firing straight on the horizon. But the problem is we were falling past the moon because we were moving so fast. But the moment we start shooting that rocket, we're no longer traveling in a circle. We start traveling in an ellipse. And we're going to hit the horizon. And so what we do is we keep, we have to change the position of that rocket to not fire straight ahead anymore. We need to tilt it down just a little bit because you want gravity to beat it, but just barely. Yeah. Kind of. I'm not really sure what you mean by that, but long story short, whichever direction you're flying, you just keep the rocket pointed in that direction. And if you do it right, if you do all this math right, you'll eventually be pointing straight at the ground. And if you listen to the Apollo astronauts as they're touching down, you'll hear Buzz Aldrin calling out these numbers and these numbers he's calling out are five and a half down. That's five and a half feet per second pointing down, meaning. So eventually if you keep going and you stop yourself from flying forward, eventually you can, you can drift down. You can just kind of float down, but you have to stop yourself, get yourself out of orbit and then slowly drift down to the ground. And then right before you touch down, you're constantly taking velocity away. So your number is going to be like really, really fast. And then it's going to slow down and down and down. And then eventually you'll get to zero right before you land. Does that make sense? It oddly does. Okay. So how do you launch the lander? What propels the lander out of the spacecraft? What propels the lander out of the spacecraft? You're telling me there's a rocket that is on grimaces undercarriage. But you're telling me that that undercarriage is pointed away from the rocket. So it seems like that rocket would be firing in the opposite direction of what would be helpful. How do you project the lander away from the spacecraft in lunar orbit to get it to take on that trajectory? Or is it just a push? You just decouple them like you just take them apart, take them apart, and then you can start shooting your rocket from the lander itself. Like what's interesting is on Apollo 11, they had a little airlock between the two spacecraft, the lunar module, the other section. When they when they broke loose, that there was a big puff of air that actually pushed the lunar module out. That was on accident. They didn't mean that happened and they overshot where they were trying to land. Really? And I actually learned this from the gentleman I had in the video. His name is Ben Feist. Super awesome, dude. He he has taken all of the Apollo data, all the video, all the audio, everything. He's put it together in one website so that you can you can see it play out in real time. Fascinating. So he's the guy who has ordered all of this stuff in his mind. He knows what's going on in all the different moving parts. This was commanded from Houston, right? Right. But not only has he ordered it in his mind, he's laid it out on a website called Apollo in realtime.org. And this guy is he is more like you than he is me. Like he understands history and the important in fact, he was actually doing something to do you want to just get him online? If you've got him, absolutely. That always makes things better. Yeah, his name is Ben Feist Apollo in realtime.org. Let me let me reach out to him real quick. Yeah. That that's an option for you is brilliant. Yes. So. Ben, what's up? How's it going? Good. How are you doing? Well, you're nonstop. You're like fooling me from the car. Tell me that you're. I can verify. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, man. I go hard. So this is Matt. This is my buddy, Matt. What's up, Ben? Not much. How are you doing? Great, man. OK. So so Matt is a I'll call Matt a historian to simplify things, but Matt's really into history. He likes science and he's certainly very good at science, but he's much more into the history side of what you've done with Apollo in realtime.org. Oh, great. And I was just hoping you could just kind of tell Matt a little bit about what you've done. And I'm sure he's going to have some really interesting questions that I did not have when I first met you. So can you kind of give it overarching, like what the project is and how you started it and all that kind of stuff? Sure. It's the ultimate CD ROM is the running joke that my friends always say. It's a collection of all the historical material from the first mission I did was the Apollo 17 mission. So I'll just talk about that one. It's every word spoken, all the recordings of what people said and all the transcripts of those recordings, every photograph taken all the 16 millimeter footage and television broadcast that were broadcast down from the moon, which is, you know, an interesting assemblage of historical material. But the differentiator is that this places all that material into the back into the moment that it actually happened on the mission. So it kind of has this effective dropping you back into the moment of want to be Apollo missions and let's see be a fly on the wall. So you have all the correspondence from everybody on all sides. Yes. Well, for 17, not everybody for 11 and 13. Yes, everybody. The mission control recordings for Apollo 17 and some of the other missions have not yet been digitized and the tapes are in the National Archives. For other people who don't know. I know, I totally know. But for other people who aren't so lucky to know, could you just review for them what Apollo 17, 11 and 13 are? Sure. Yes. The Apollo, these are three of the six Apollo missions that landed on the surface of the moon. Actually, 13 didn't land on the moon. There was an explosion on board. So it's one of the Apollo missions and the Apollo program was basically humanity's effort to attempt to go to the moon. And they achieved that. I'm sure most people know that for the first time on Apollo 11, where Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the moon. And then they did that actually five more times successfully. And so there are 12 people that have been on the moon. When I discovered this material that it exists out there and that it might be something that could be pulled together into a multimedia experience. I just couldn't think of a better way to be selfishly put myself into a place where I never could have been firsthand and see what it was. I actually like to be there. OK, I got a weird question for you, Ben. I know why they called the Gemini missions Gemini because they are and you get to Thomas. It's did a miss. It's a twin thing. But why Apollo? I actually don't know the answer to that question. Dustin, you know that one? I don't know. Sure. Don't. I mean, Apollo is Diana's twin brother. So well, Artemis. Artemis is twin brother. Yeah. Yeah, well, same same character. And so I don't know. Apollo was cool and did cool things. He fought a giant python. Like I just don't. I don't know what the connection is. I've always been curious about that. I don't know. It could just be that it's the God, you know, it's the chief God. It's the bigger Gemini. I don't know. It could just be something that simple. And, you know, I wouldn't put it past the people at NASA to post rationalize anything. So I'm sure you'd be developing that to research. OK. Well, it sounds like we all have that in common with NASA then. So you said 17 is the one that you reestablished end to end. It's the first one. So it's the one I actually grabbed hold of one of the missions and said, I wonder what it would be like to try to make this thing. And that took six years of work. It was a very long process. Can I just kind of show you what it is real quick, Matt? Like, so can you can you see my screen? Can you see the website here? OK, so what you want to beautifully put together? It was just first impression. Gorgeous. Bring up 11 just because it will look the same as what 17 looks like now, but it has the extra level of detail. OK. So so there's a you're presented with two things. One is, you know, if you wanted to go to the countdown. And then the other one is you want to use today's clock to jump into the mission. Like what was happening right now in the mission? Now, that's kind of a fudge because it's not in July right now. But during the anniversary of the mission, that button brings you what was happening in this coming July will be the 52nd anniversary of Apollo 11. So it's kind of like an I'm feeling lucky button on Google. Just a random point in the mission. So what do you want, Matt? Yeah, give me the. Well, start with now. I want to know. OK. Who might be sleeping? So can you actually hear my audio? Yeah. I want to know. So just explain what's going on here, Ben. Yeah. So you've jumped in. Let's see. Where are you? You're just if you look at the very top of that weird looking thing, you'll see that they're just on their way to the moon. They've started translinar injection. And they're on their way to the moon. It's going to take them three days at this point to get there. So you're listening to the flight. In this case, the voice you hear is Gene Krantz. He's the flight director on shift right now. Talking to his flight controllers. And I don't see there's not a lot of activity. If you look in a transcript in the bottom left, there's just kind of a little bit of housekeeping, but not really much going on right now. Yeah, but check this out, Matt. So I can click on Mission Control audio here. And you can see all of the desks in Mission Control. And you can click on any one of them. Are we still on star 40? I'm 40 coming up in the last mark. That's amazing. You're all done. Ben, what an accomplishment. This is amazing. Oh, thank you. Yeah. So if you ever wanted to be the flight dynamics officer in Mission Control on Apollo 11, you can just go sit at that desk for the whole 240 hours of the mission on here on Apollo 11. Isn't that amazing? It's not just brilliant because you did the work to gather all the data and put it together. It's brilliant because you thought of a way to go beyond the typical historian's weapon, which is a paper with words on it. And you figured out how to make this completely immersive. You had to invent a whole new genre of website. You do invent a whole new genre of communicating history to do. This is genius. Oh, geez. Thank you. I don't know how much I invented it. It's a little bit like if you had, you know, security camera footage in Mission Control, a lot of cameras and you just turn that on. So is there some stuff in here that the people on console probably would have not wanted to be put in this circle? Really? Like what? Actually, I heard I heard from somebody who currently works on console who said this sent shivers up his spine that somebody might ever do this with some of the things he's done. But, you know, there's there's moments like people just kind of joking around with each other a little bit, especially during the night shift when the crew is asleep and they're just monitoring systems. There's a few times where a flight controller is hitting on somebody on the phone, repeatedly, that kind of thing. You know, and there's this online community of people that are finding moments like that in here. And they're talking about, we need to know if the date happened. Wow. So really it's just putting, oh, no, you won't be able to find it there. OK, yeah. So there's a search function. So I can actually search in here. You're searching the transcript when you search there. Oh, OK. And all the audio in Mission Control is not transcribed. Oh, the transcript is just the space to ground transcript. Got it from Capcom. Yeah. That's awesome. OK, so it's a 240 hour mission. Yeah. Correct. How much of that is the flight in one direction? Let's see. Half, roughly half. OK. Then what if we do this before you got on the call, Matt and I were talking about what it's like to descend to the surface. Yeah. And I was explaining how Buzz was calling out the velocity as you approach down there. So where would we go? I'm clicking on down to the surface here. Yeah. So close that. There we go. So we just landed. OK, so let me back up a little bit. They use the use the other two levels to be more refined and this level right here. Yeah. Oh, I get it. Those are three levels of magnification of the timeline because one pixel movement is going to be about half an hour of the top one. So this is them descending here, right? No, they're already on the surface. So if you look to the left of the middle bar, you moved it. So most off the whole thing for a second to jump back. Now you can see the middle bar says on the surface. Go back to the eagle is landed. Keep going left. Oh, I see it. There you go. That blue bar underneath is a delineator that shows that there's video and the little green text show that the photograph is being taken. So that's when the photographs change. So if I play this, we should be able to hear buzz calling out velocity towards the surface. Yeah. This is an incredible level of detail. This is an amazing project. All right, here we go. Everybody. Seven hundred and fifty. She's going out of twenty three. I'm going to see only one now. Thirty three degrees. For the rock area. That's not in the data. Nineteen. I'm going to have 140 feet down and three. I have two feet. OK, so Matt, just to give you context, they are coming down at fifteen feet per second, which is fast. You know, if you're trying to land, that'll break. Just break the legs, right? Right. And but he's calling out thirty five degrees. That's correct me if I'm wrong, Ben. Isn't that the angle of the landers that's coming down? I don't know, actually. It must be. I would assume. I don't know. But just listen to what he's doing here as he's landing and just kind of get in the lunar lander with him. Thank you. What's the time code of the landing? Right. That you can see it on the surface. Yep. Let's go right here. Let's just play it from here. That's good. And twenty feet. And it's three three and a half down nine forward. I've been there. But anyway. Eight seventy five feet. We're going to get down a half forward. Sixteen. Sixteen seven. Fifty seven. Five pounds. Right. Sixteen. Down. Good. And. Forward forward forward. That's good. Fourteen. Down. Gonna have. I got some. Thirty feet. Two and a half down. Three. Down. Four. Four. Four. We're drifting in the right. All right. All right. All right. All right. One um I like. The the teenagers. There as a meter out. The world's all over they can relax and he wants you. Yeah, if you want to open the mission control audio for a second here. Uh huh. The recovery channel, if you can find that, I think you have to play to make the buttons light up. Where is it? Recovery status right here. Yeah, try that one. Okay. Hit play. It's playing your website made me cry Ben. Hey, jump back a little bit. Jump back like 15 seconds. Yeah, click there. Can hear him clapping. So he was one of the guys in mission control and he was reading out. He was saying he was relaying to the Hornet so that the people on the ship could hear them landing. Listen the way he says. He goes on the moon. Yeah. Yeah. So that's like, you know, that's the only channel where there's someone saying, uh, all right here again. Something with emotion. We are down. Eagle is on the moon. He's going to go ahead. Eagle has land. We got the on the ground. We got a good guy. That's amazing. Yeah. So that's audio has never been heard until this project pulled it all together. That's awesome. Man, that's incredible. So where do you go get this audio? Oh man. How long you got? How long is this episode? It's just given the short version. Sure. Well, um, it was actually another group of people funded by the National Science Foundation that were digitizing these tapes. These are 30 track tapes. So there's two concurrently rolling 30 track tapes for 60 channels of audio that they use for audit purposes. So they kind of recorded everybody on console. Every microphone you see in the footage of somebody in mission controls going on to one of these tracks. And then at the end of the mission, they didn't have any problems on 11. They didn't need to go back and investigate or do anything like that. So they just accessioned these tapes to the National Archives. And there's one machine in the world that will still play these tapes back. And it's in Houston. So these tapes are in College Park, Maryland. The machines in Houston and the machine is broken. So they had to, you know, this is the long story. So I won't go into it. No, keep going. Keep going. This is interesting. Yeah. So they had to have a three track tape head fabricated and put on this old machine. And these tapes roll really slowly. It's 15, 16, seven inch per second. So this old machine, the size of a washing machine and emission control is rolling these tapes. They're 16 hours long per tape into a digitization harness that has been was created for this purpose. And, you know, it did an okay job of pulling that audio off the tapes and into the digital realm, essentially rescuing it really. Like if you think about these tapes sitting in the National Archives, eventually that machine would have broken and then it would just be an order of magnitude harder to ever listen to them. But that machine being, you know, 60 or 70 years old introduced all kinds of audio artifacts into the recordings. And the team that worked on this project, the Apollo and real time restoration team wrote a custom algorithm that re-speeded the tapes. Did you write the algorithm? Personally, I did not. Yeah, the team wrote the algorithm. Jeremy Cooper, who's a developer in California, took on the challenge and he's a signals expert and expert programmer. Like I'm a software engineer, I wrote this website. I can barely even understand what he wrote. It literally looks at the pitch that's being generated on the timecode signal that's on track one of these tapes and figures out what the deviation from what that spec of that timecode is, like thousands of times a second and re-speeds it so that it retimes, it makes it a perfect timecode as I was being generated today. And then the correction that's required to do that gets applied to all the adjacent tracks. And it's like magic. Like these tapes go from drifting in time, like 45 minutes over 16 hours and sounding like everybody's worried because there's a warbling going on to sounding like they were recorded on a digital audio recorder in 1969. So that metronome, so to speak, that signal that was on track one, you told me when we first talked that that's iRig. Yeah, it's iRig B. Right, which I didn't, Matt, iRig is a, correct me if I'm wrong, Ben, because you are certainly the expert at the table. But iRig is a essentially a metronome broadcast by satellites. Today it's on GPS satellites and it's being down at a certain frequency. I think it's one pulse per second. Is that correct, Ben? Well, B is one pulse per second. I'm not sure what the different levels of iRig are. I didn't know that it was on the GPS signal, so there you go. We're helping each other understand. Well, now you can pick up iRig with the GPS antenna. And so long story short, if you're on a test range, Matt, and you have to synchronize a bunch of cameras and they're miles apart, you set out a GPS antenna and that GPS antenna will receive a pulse per second. And there's also some sidecar type data. That's not the term, but you understand what I'm saying when I say it that way. There's some other data that can let you synchronize your camera down to the microsecond. Do they invent iRig for the Apollo mission? I don't think so. Well, I would say I'm reacting to that. I mean, maybe they did, but I don't think so because there's so little documentation about it. It took us a really long time to figure out what the signal was on track one. And then in NASA's own history of its recording of these things, their history doesn't go back as far as this. They would have been very proud of the fact they invented this standard and they would have continued to use it. I have a feeling that they had like an off the shelf if there was a shelf back then device that was generating this. And we found some documentation that showed that they were actually generating this time code to use across systems at Johnson Space Center. This was part of a signaling process that was going through the different systems and mission control. And it was just being recorded on track one. How many honorary doctorates have you received for this project? If it's less than five, I'm going to start writing letters. I think Jeremy needs to definitely get some recognition other than the mention by me and this podcast for his contribution. And his code, by the way, is all open source on GitHub. If anybody ever comes across the need to deflutter anything that has an adjacent iRig B track, you're sad. No, I say that because this is beyond dissertation PhD worthy. This is a massive achievement. Orders of magnitude. We're at contribution to humanity level. Yes. Orders of magnitude greater than what you get out of a typical PhD dissertation, most of which you will find are just there to justify the degree. Every now and then you see a dissertation or thesis that really does move the conversation forward in a meaningful way. You took something that had no business ever being reassembled and put it together better than it was put together in the first place. This is better access to the data than anyone has ever had, including the people who actually did it in real time. This is incredible. That's a really good point, Matt. So let me, Ben, I'm going to just go ahead and explain this to Matt because I don't want you to have to explain it. And I know you're super humble and you probably don't want to do that, but here's the deal. So Ben did this and impressed NASA so much that he's now working for NASA to do this. Like for example, today there was an international space station EVA, extravascular activity, and Ben was involved on console to capture it real time, put it all on a can so that we could have that data for the future. Am I saying that correctly? Yeah, that's pretty much it. So I didn't get it honorary doctorate, but I got a job at NASA to help them with future missions, which is fantastic. Wait, really? Yes. That's what you do now? This was your job application? Yes. We just want to give you like we'd be interested in working with you. Could you just give us some small sample of your work? Well, I did this thing here. Yes, that will work fine. Would you like the president's office? It is insane. I'm really glad that this is paid off beyond just a contribution to humanity. You should be the guy. This is incredible. Yeah, it was really great. I mean, somebody who's a good friend of mine now, Noah Petro, just emailed me one day and said, this is amazing. This thing you've done for Apollo 17. And essentially, like after we struck up a friendship, you said, hey, when do you come down to Goddard Space Flight Center and give a presentation for the anniversary of Apollo 17? And I did. And on that very day, they invited me to come into the field with them and start working with them to try to help. And it was really disorienting because I was like, oh, I can tell my grandkids I got to go to NASA and give a presentation of other work I did. Done. Jerry on the cake on this project, like over, right? I gave the presentation and it I felt great. Like I usually do after a big presentation or something, whether it went well or not, right? And then we went for lunch and he said, we need to get back to the office because there's a meeting and I was like, okay, well, give me a room to check email. He said, no, no, no, the meeting is with you. Like there's people that want to meet you. And in that meeting, they said, what you've done here might be our solution to this problem we've been trying to solve around how we organize our data. Would you be interested in coming into the field with us and helping us to, or just observe about how we do it wrong right now and you can help us to consult to make it right? My life changed in that moment, really. Like it was, it wasn't like, here's a job and here's how much it pays and like, let's go. It was just, hey, do you want to come? So from there, over about an 18 month period, it was like every time they gave me an opportunity to contribute, I would not shy away from it and see what I could do. And then eventually they called one day and said, listen, your name is on so many things for the coming year. We're tired of explaining who you are. Like you're this guy that made this website, but it's okay. He's good. You know, you can involve him in your project. It would be easier if you were just Ben at NASA. Like does that sound good to you? And I was like, oh, yes, let's make that happen. I will never forget the day that I became Matt at Burger King. They were like, you eat a lot of hamburgers here. Is there any chance you'd like to make a few? And I was like, yes, manager Brian, I would. And he was like, be here tomorrow and wear this shirt and don't complain. And I did that for weeks, literally weeks. No, it's just, I mean, what an unbelievable, I mean, all space stuff aside, what a fun story to get to hear. Because your life didn't change in that day, respectfully, I'm not trying to be too preachy, but it didn't. And it didn't change in the six years you did the project. It changed when you decided to nurture the skill set. And then instead of just figuring out how to convert it into money, you figured out how to run with ideas and stuff you were passionate about. And that crap is contagious. A hundred percent. People love that. I'm really glad you picked up on that part of it. I'm 20 some odd years into my career as a software engineer. And I've worked on the side of things that you can see, multimedia type experiences like this one, well, not like this one, but in the same category, like coding stuff that you can look at. It was really all about survival in that industry and keeping clients happy and working on projects. And you get good at that. And you can really easily, like I did, forget to do something also for yourself. Because you're tired at the end of the day. Where's the room for that in your life? But if you don't make the room, like, A, it was a way for me to unwind after work. It wasn't an additional job. I'm sure it took six years, but it wasn't six years of horrible pain. It was, I often equated it to reading a novel, which if you broke down into how many hours that takes and treated it like a job, that would be a horrendous task. But if it's something that recharges you from the other things that you're doing, then it's not a horrendous task. And that's what this was. Yeah. So where maybe most of the world is putting weed and Xbox, you put busting your butt on this thing. I mean, you get what I'm saying. Everybody wants to unwind. Everybody wants to relax after work. Everybody wants, has their process by which they go to their happy place, think about something else, engage in different brain patterns. And just what I think is cool about what you're telling me is that that space that most people, me included, use on one squandering of time or another, you used on this thing. It became your fun thing. It became the place you wanted to go. And the thing you thought about on the side, and it just happened to be wildly more productive than the incredibly elaborate Skyrim save file that I've put my time into. Right. But that's only incidental. If it was a Minecraft version of the Apollo missions, because that's what I was into, it could have easily been that. And that would have been a, hey, that's cool thing on Instagram, and not led to a job somewhere. That's an important point. This wasn't like, hey, follow your dream, and then somebody will notice you. And it's not that story. It's the story of being creative and creative being a positive thing. And then there's this crazy thing that happened that it turned up to be a solution to a problem NASA was trying to solve, which I did not even imagine. It's awesome. Let me ask you this, Ben, does this exist? Like, could somebody download this in any way? Or does it only exist in the website? It exists on GitHub. It's free to download. It is the code that is that runs the website and the transcripts and all the restored textual data is all in GitHub. And then all the videos are on YouTube. So someone could go download all the videos and then reconstruct this thing, because it's hard to package up. It's very big. I was joking that it's a giant CD-ROM. If it was, the Apollo 17 mission would be something on the order of 3000 CD-ROMs and length, like it's a huge amount of data. Yes, I've done my best to try to make it so that it will live on past my current interest in keeping it online. Do you have the ability to see what parts of the missions people most frequently want to go and check out? Yes. It's not really done that way, but there are statistics that show different timestamps of when people arrive on the website, because there is the ability to share a link to a given moment. So you can say, hey, my favorite thing to do is somebody posts a picture of in a Apollo 17 photo that was taken on the surface of the moon. And I go, hey, if you want to see the actual moment of this photo is taken, click this link. And then they share enough there, the photo arrives, and then they're on the moon for three days. They could accidentally get sucked in for hours, which is now my new hobby, to try to get people to get sucked in for hours. I could say I would work. What are the hot spots? What does everybody want to see? Well, it's actually not what you would think. It's not like there's a best of that people want to come in on. It's really the thing that I also didn't anticipate is that emotional feeling of following along with the current time during the anniversary of the mission really has an emotional effect. I know it does on me, but it's really resonated with people online. So during the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, this was going bananas. And the amount of bandwidths being downloaded. And we had a million concurrent viewers watching Apollo 11 in real time. And that included like a million. Yeah, like they're like all teamed in listening to the radio type thing. Then they would leave and come back. It followed literally the ratings of the actual mission in the 50 years earlier. It was a little bit showed up for launch. Lots of people showed up for first steps on the men. And then a few people paid attention for reentry and recovery. And then for the rest of it, it was like troughs. So it would go up to tens of thousands of those moments down to troughs of hundreds of people that were tuned in. And you could just come back, just drop in, hey, what are they doing now? And you just open the website and it would like, oh, they're not waking up for another four hours. I'll come back in four hours and see what they're going to do today. I've got one more question I'd like to hit you with. It's an odd question, but I think I'm sensing you'll see what I'm driving at. What does the moon landing mean? Well, it's come to mean a lot more in hindsight than I think it did at the time. I was just talking to my good friend, Stephen Slater yesterday. And he pointed out that this was just an ephemeral thing that was happening at the time. It was like anything else that was happening. People paid attention and the world stopped possibly for 10 minutes when Neil stepped onto the surface of the moon. But the looking back has shown us that this is what could happen when 400,000 people all with a common purpose work together to make something happen. It really shows the best of what we can be when we work together. And that's the thing that keeps coming back to me with looking at this material and then also looking forward to our return to the moon, which is on the table right now for us to do. And everybody getting very excited about rallying together to make something like that happen again. This is like a living metaphor for the power of multiple processors. And in a way, it's a bit of a pushback on the American rugged individualism thing, which I really, really like. I love the idea of the individual versus nature and using the one processor to defeat things. But there's a glass ceiling to how much even the best mind can process. How many problems the best mind can solve. And as you've been talking about all of this, I'm picturing all of the areas of specialization represented by not just the individuals at those consoles that we can click on and listen in on, but their entire teams behind them, all these people who've done things just like you've done, Ben, putting time into nurturing this skill set to being able to think philosophically and ethically and from a problem-solving perspective to figure out what they do know, what they don't know, what they can't know, what they need somebody else to know, where I would need somebody else's 20 years of investment to fill in this blank spot that I don't have enough lifetime or processing power to get. You put 400,000 processors on that mental processors, all organized in the right way. One, it's amazing that it took that much human processing to defeat something that to a simpleton like me looks like, we'll just put a big rocket on something and point it at that ball in the sky. You should get there, it should be fine. Well, no, it's not. I mean, so one, it's a testimony to how big the problem was. And two, I'm really moved and appreciate your observation as to the power of carefully directed shared processing. People traded their life energy, their creativity, their mind space, their mind time to put that boot on that rock. And it's incredible. Yeah, there's a few different thoughts there that I'd like to add that one is that there was a common refrain from people that worked on different aspects of Apollo that it wasn't going to fail because of me. That's what they would always say. Like, I'm going to do, I'm going to be excellent in my job, whether I'm the person behind the person behind the person. And it's not about the rugged individualism that you talked about. It's about everybody just being excellent in what they do because the stakes are very high. And somehow, like, especially in our current political situation, it's very complex. The arrows were pointed in roughly the same direction of people's purpose. And that is not easy to do. I mean, if you think about all those to use your metaphor of multiple processors, is they're all working against each other or they're working in counterproductive to one another competing against each other, it's still the same amount of processing power. You're not going anywhere. So really, it's that common purpose and like the words that are used often now, like it's a nation committing itself to doing something. And then people allowing their patriotism and their self identity within that process to be at their best and to focus on that goal. You know, how did that happen? And there's been a lot of history that's been written up to try to figure out how that happened. Like that transcends a four-year presidential term, that transcends any kind of been fighting for funding within Congress. And it wasn't clean. Like, this is another really important point. It wasn't like, oh, that was back when we all had common purpose. Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, people were fighting constantly. And even within NASA, if you look into the history and the depth of the kind of deep dive that I've gone into, it was a lot of bureaucracy. There was a lot of people that wanted, you know, no, I want my team to be doing this, not that other team. There's a lot of competitiveness and like even some of the top people that did a lot of the science operations in Johnson Space Center said like, every time I wanted to get something done, I just talked to the head of Johnson Space Center and went past everybody. I don't know what the right way was that you were supposed to do it, but that's how I did it, you know, things like that. You know, so I think that's a really important lesson because with the distance in history, you can be tempted to look back and go. This is when everybody was different than they are now. And you know, that leaves the self doubt like, oh, could we ever do that again? I could, it's really messy from my desk. And it looks so nice and clean with, you know, pretty music in the documentary about the past. Well, if you listen to that 30 track audio, there's like people getting in trouble for sleeping in and almost missing their shift. There's someone asking where the overtime cards are because they want to clock some overtime. You know, they were good at their jobs and nothing untoward ever happened in the recordings. I can assure you that I came across anyway. But they're normal people. They're just like the people that work in Mission Control today. I think all that stuff together both makes Apollo something for us to focus on, but it also just hopefully it's inspirational that we had something like, hey, what can we do if we decide to get past our differences and try to have a common purpose? Thank you for entertaining my question there about what this means. And I appreciate your answer. I appreciate it to the degree that I get why this is awesome, better now than I ever have in my entire life. This was one small step forward for you in conversation and one giant step forward for me in understanding why this thing was amazing and what it means. Thanks for indulging that. Oh, thanks for giving me the opportunity to preach. It was a good sermon. Apollo in realtime.org. Go check out what Ben has done. Is there any way people can support you? Nope, just go and enjoy yourself. That's awesome. Sweet. Ben, this is awesome, man. Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. Hey, no pleasure. This episode of Notre Dame Questions is sponsored by HelloFresh. And we have a ridiculous promo code. Matt, I just want you to kind of tell me how this works because if I'm reading this correctly, 10 free meals, including free shipping. I don't see where I'm needed in that equation. I think you just spelled it out. So here's the thing. The human body requires food in order to function. And if you don't put some in there in rather regular intervals, you die. We don't want that for you. We don't want that for anyone. So you're going to want to eat food. Take it from us. We've been food eaters our whole lives. Well, it turns out that food costs money because of the production effort that goes into it. So if there were an opportunity for you to get a thing you need to sustain your existence and it were free and you could get 10 of those things, I think that would be a thing you want. And that's why I like this promotion there. Dude, that was wonderful. Thank you for doing it that way. That was fantastic. Yeah. No, here's the deal. This is a ridiculous offer. And I'm sold on HelloFresh. Great food comes straight to your door. You got all the ingredients you need. You get a little card with easy step-by-step instructions and you get to cook. Like you get to learn how to do the steps to make an amazing meal. And when you get done, you like want to pat yourself on the back because you feel like you did an amazing thing because you did. It's awesome. So here's the deal. The promo code. You go to hellofresh.com slash 10 NDQ. That's 10. I'll give it to you phonetically. It's no dumb questions. NDQ. But it's 10 November delta Quebec. And the promo code is 10 NDQ at checkout. And that's 10 free meals including free shipping. This is the deal you need to do. It's amazing. We love it. Our family loves it. Well, my family, I guess we're kind of family. We don't technically have the same literal family, but we overlap quite a bit. I mean, it's good. Yeah, it's pretty good. And before we get out of here, one of the things I got to say that I'm really liking about HelloFresh is it seems like they are always expanding the menu and coming up with more ways to scratch the food itches that people would have. So they've got low calorie options. They've got limited carb options. They've got vegetarian options. They got the fish-a-terian options that people are liking more and more. It's called Pescatarian, right? Yeah, fish-a-terian. I don't know. Dude, I just catch the fish. And then I tell them how much I admire their beauty. And then I put them back into nature. Other people like to eat the fish. I can respect that, but it's a confusing term for me. So the thing about it is, you know, as people think more about what they put in their bodies, HelloFresh has been on the exact same trajectory thinking more about what you put in your bodies. So pretty much whatever you're doing food-wise, there's a HelloFresh that's going to fit with that. And on top of that, it's super sustainable. Smart people who research these things get to think like, well, I mean, how does this delivery thing work? Would that actually be a savings or a net drain on everything in terms of resources? And according to the University of Michigan, it is actually a net saver in terms of sustainability and resources. More than that, though, it's the money thing too, right? If you do this right, it cuts down your grocery bill by saving up to 40% instead of shopping at your local store. But like, if you think about the promo code, it saves 100% on those 10 meals. Because math. Because math. And remember, you have to eat. It's absolutely mandatory. So it seems like this is a real opportunity to link your needs with tremendous financial benefit. Okay, to get your mitts on America's number one meal kit delivery service. Hello, Fresh. You got a HelloFresh.com. Let's do this, Matt. I just want to see how in sync we are because there is a delay between me and you. I want to know if we can say the promo code at the same time together and overlap. You ready? Dustin, in the past, we've done, and by we, I mean me, I think some of the best advertising jingle work in the history of podcast advertising for HelloFresh. Possibly the world. Yes, I'm with you. Possibly. This time around, I think we should do something that is a little less ambitious, but simply two tone, 16th century, Gregorian chant style reading of the jingle. Okay. I believe we've got this. Okay, I'm down. Let's do it. So simply two pitches. I think that's the correct intro. Hello Fresh.com. Yep. Okay. You got it? Yep. And we're going to go to HelloFresh.com slash 10 and DQ. Like that? Yeah. Well, let's make it sound like it's in a cathedral. So that's going to be your pitch. Yeah, that's it. Okay. I got mine ready. I'm mad at us right now. Okay, I'm ready. Let's do it. Ready? Hello Fresh.com slash and DQ. You're doing it wrong. It's 10 and DQ. Just follow my lead. Yeah. Hello Fresh.com slash 10 and DQ. This is awful. We're going to do the whole thing. Wait, I'll follow your lead again. We got to do the whole thing. Ready? Ready? Yes. Go. Hello Fresh.com slash 10 and DQ and use code 10 and DQ for 10 meals, including free shipping. Why? They should get Hello Fresh. Hello Fresh. All right. Let's talk about space. Was that awesome or what? Yeah, that was excellent. It was moving. I wasn't goofing around it. It made me cry, man. I know. And I've seen that. Well, I haven't seen that footage. That footage was actually the most boringest footage of all the footage I've ever seen of the moon landing. But it was, I think, seeing all the anticipation and understanding that if it took six years to just reestablish the conversation around it, something snapped for me. No, snap makes it sound like it's bad. Something clicked for me today in terms of valuing and appreciating properly appraising the significance of that achievement. Yeah. What was really interesting was seeing the people back in mission control react real time to when the landing happened. And you see Gene Krantz take a real big pull on a cigarette and just put it out in the ashtray right there right before landing and you're like, that dude's about to have a heart attack. But Gene Krantz is known to be like just ice water in the veins, just total professional is amazing. I've never seen anything like it. So Apollo in real time.org. The thing about getting into some of the stuff that you're into is that I wouldn't even think to ask the question, the tensions that would lead to those innovations have not occurred to me. As soon as you explain the tension to me, then my little hamster wheel can start turning in my head and I will get eventually to what the problem is going to be or it's going to make sense at least at the beginning level. But that's part of what's fun about doing these episodes where we deep dive into projects you're doing on Smarter Every Day is not just the solution. It's the process of you leading me to a place where I even get why you asked the question in the first place. And this is another one of those. I love what it does for my brain and I hope it has a similar effect on the third chair. With the beauty of this particular problem is that we have the benefit of your discipline, which is history. And because these problems were solved in the past, we get to go back and ask, well, how did you solve it? And why did you solve it this way instead of a different way? Because there are reasons. For example, they may have been limited by processing technology. They may have been limited by an inertial measurement unit, you know, data rate, for example. So if we talk to Wayne Audinger, who was an engineer on the LLTV program, and we ask him why he did certain things, we may be able to reproduce what he did in a better way, because we do have the technology that can do the thing he couldn't do in the past. Or you might find out that technology's technology, that was the best you could do it. Yeah, keep it simple, stupid. And maybe what they've got is awesome. And what they did is awesome. What I love is that you're describing a historical principle that should be one of the four or five principles of understanding the past that everyone, everyone should take with them when they go and think about what people before us did. But we don't. There are these two forces that are at work in our brains when we look back any further than last week. Force number one is forgetfulness. We're really usually up to date on what's going on right now. We're more up to date and can better reconstruct today than we can reconstruct what happened to seven days ago. You think about what your degradation curve looks like for detail memory? It's a pretty quick taper, right? Yeah, you need hooks to remember stuff from a week ago, two weeks ago, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, everything else just goes downstream to stay sane. So you got that one thing that happens in our brains when we try to evaluate and think about and interpret history. But the other thing you have is the assumption that now is better and smarter. Chronological snobbery is what C.S. Lewis calls that. Yeah, and we've talked about that before. And part of it is a chronological snobbery of ethics. We're much more ethically enlightened than anybody was before us. Well, I take exception to that. I go, yeah, we've accomplished some things, but we didn't defeat slavery and get women the vote. People who are now dead did that and they deserve moral credit for that. So no, I don't think we are better than them for all of the ills of the past. There was also somebody dead who came along and made those ills go away. That assumption that we are morally superior to people of the past. I don't think that's a safe assumption. I think that assumption could be better stated as there are things we generally hold to now that are morally better than things that some people generally held to in the past. But there are also exceptions and we're in no good position to self criticize. We don't know why we suck now. The people a generation or two or five from now will be crystal clear on what we were stupid about, just like we're crystal clear on what we think people were stupid about five generations ago. Hopefully people five generations from now will be maybe a little bit more gentle on us than we are right now on the people who came before us. But whether they are not, this idea of moral superiority historically and intellectual superiority historically is something that we just can't seem to help bringing with us to thinking about history. We don't give people in the past the benefit of the doubt. And maybe it's because we know we never have to face them or argue with them. But if we do what you just did with this project, what Ben just did, which is assume the sanity and intelligence of all the people you are studying, your history inquiry works way better. Everything makes more sense. Everything clicks. But if you start by assuming they were dumb or immoral, their actions don't make much sense. And so you're telling me you look back on this thing. And what you're seeing is engineering decisions that could take you two years to reconstruct the parameters within which that person made that decision. But you'd be wasting your two years because by the time you get done with it, all you'd be like, Oh, yeah, that guy was right. Yep. You knew the playing field and you nailed it. Well, what you're saying brings up two thoughts in my mind. And they both have to do with people that I interviewed for this video. Number one was Ben Feist who we just interviewed. So the beauty of his project here is that it brought to light that these people are real people. Like Ben said, when we watched the documentary, there's soft music playing and it's heroic and amazing. But this task was taken on by normal people. And they did amazing things. And by listening to them on console, we can hear their normalness. And we can hear all the things they were dealing with. And so that's fascinating and amazing. But another thing that really, really struck me when I was making this video is speaking to the engineer who helped make the LLTV, Mr. Wayne Audinger. I asked him a question because when I look back at this as an engineer today, with more computational power in my cell phone in my hand, and they had on the entire system that went to the moon, I look back and I see my grandfather's slide rule, you know, and he worked on test stands for the rockets and stuff. And I'm like, man, I think they were just better. I think they were better. But I actually asked Mr. Audinger that. And he was there. So he's an authority on the topic. And if it's cool, I would like to play his response to my question. Is that okay? If I play that real quick? More than cool, please. Mr. Anagir, I know that I need to let you go. But I would like to ask you two more questions. And these are big picture questions. Thank you for how generous you've been with your time. But first big picture question is, so back in the day, the engineers and scientists on this program did amazing things with limited electronics. Right. So do you think that engineers in the 50s and 60s were better than engineers today? No, no, I think we all had our unique place in the history and they'll continue to be a, you know, new challenges met. That'll be innovation that continues. And part of it's because they can build on our shoulders. They can learn from what we did and adapt to the technology and self-worth. The way he says no, like I remember in the moment, you know, because I, here I am sitting in an engineer today and I'm thinking about, I have access to finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, all kind of like, we can solve crazy problems today with computers. And they, they couldn't, but they did. And they've literally invented integrated circuits to do this. And so, I looked back at what all they were doing and I thought, man, they're just better. And then to hear, not just him say no, engineers weren't better, but the way he said it, no, no, no, that was part of his soul. He meant that. I don't know. It was just a really neat look. This whole thing was a really neat look back into the complexities of the problem, but also the men and women that rose to the occasion and got it done and their normalness. And I'm looking forward to the Artemis program to see normal people do the same thing again, to ultimately go further and beyond and do like Mr. Ottinger said and build on their shoulders. If you'll indulge me, I'd like to end on one more thing. So, I would like you to verbally describe to me, I'm going to close my eyes and I'm in orbit around the moon. I would like you to take me all the way to the ground on the moon. Tell me what I need to do with my thrusters, where I need to point them and how I need to fire them. Go. All right, game on. No, I'm serious. Yeah. Okay. No, here we go. We're in orbit. I'm going to start with an 8-bit video game view of this. So, we have a camera mounted on the front of our spacecraft and we have the partial sphere of the moon in the lower third of the shot. Okay. Space is in the upper two thirds. We are falling toward the moon at a rapid rate, but we are also moving forward at a rapid enough rate that that collapse is not truly felt. We are in orbit. There is a separation that occurs with our lunar lander. I can picture the little burst of air. Like you see, anytime an airlock gets broken in any kind of space or sci-fi show, I can picture our gumdrop shaped grimace lunar lander module legs out being nudged forward. So it is being moved forward, but at a slight angle of declination down toward that orb of the moon that we're seeing in the lower third of the shot. The spacecraft continues to move forward and we see that lunar lander briefly come into our shot, but fade out of the bottom of the shot down toward the moon as the spacecraft continues on in orbit. Cut to a second shot that is more of a side view with that lunar lander feet out headed toward the surface. It's not moving straight down toward the surface like a lunar elevator. It's moving at a, I would say a relatively shallow angle coming down toward the surface, maybe not like an airplane landing angle, but shallower than a straight drop. To begin with, it's going parallel to the surface of the moon. Almost parallel though, right? To begin with, we're in orbit. Oh, in orbit. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, we're still in orbit. So it's going parallel. You haven't fired a rocket yet. No, I haven't fired a rocket yet. Like if you were to look at the side view of the moon as a circle, we're in a bigger circle around the moon. But this next orbit that we've initiated by the way we separated, it's putting it in a lower orbit than the spacecraft even initially, even if just barely a lower orbit, correct? No, no, no, no at all. So they're still in identical position. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I thought you explained it that the separation caused the initial nudge toward the lower orbit at which point then we fire lightly to get into the declination that we want. Okay, so we're there. So we have fired a rocket and we are controlling our pitch using the what you call the pulses. Attitudes control thrusters. That's what I was going to say almost exactly except none of those words. And so what we have now is whoever is on the comms inside is monitoring how quickly we are in decline. So is that in feet per second? 15 feet per second? It's whatever you want it to be. We can do first. Let's pretend that is. Yeah, feet per second. Yep. Okay, obviously we're trying to control that speed with two factors. We have the ability to slow ourselves with a rocket and we have the ability to slow ourselves or to reduce the force of impact by coming in at an angle instead of coming in straight down. Is that correct? Yeah, okay. So I don't know, we've got a landing angle that we've committed to. We're maintaining that all the way through. And as we get closer, we are correcting with those thrusters to keep our lunar lander positioned in such a way that it's going to touchdown not destructively. And we didn't quite get to this point, but I assume that we're going to fire harder as we get closer to the surface so that instead of coming down like an airplane, back legs of the lander first, then we touch down, excuse me, then we touch down with the front legs of the lander. That wouldn't work. It's not built for that. It's how wheels, these are pegs, right? I mean, these are these are feet. So instead, we've got a slow to a place where we're not going to have a devastating touchdown, but we've also got to stabilize with those pulse bursts so that we're touching down effectively all feet simultaneously. Mm hmm. Yeah. Is that it? We're on the moon, man. Okay, sweet. Let's go get a scoop of dirt. I want one of those. Nice job explaining if I can even get in the zip code of something I know literally nothing about, then you've explained it well. I really enjoyed processing all this because we kind of spent a lot of time in your area of expertise, the history side. Yeah. But it also touches mine. So we're in that like sweet, Venn diagram place and the queue sliver. Yeah. I like that spot. But I really enjoyed this one thing that Ben said, and I was hoping we could end on this. Is that cool with you? Yeah. Let's give him the last word. The looking back has shown us that this is what could happen when 400,000 people all with a common purpose work together to make something happen.
