This is the podcast called No Dum questions where I talk about interesting things with my buddy Matt Whitman. How's it going Matt? Things are super. Thank you for the warm introduction my friend. Oh, you're welcome. This is one of my favorite types of episodes Matt where we go both listen to the same book on audible. In this case, it's getting to yes, negotiating agreement without giving in by Roger Fisher and William Uri or Yuri. How do you say his last name? I guess I would say Uri. Uri? Yeah, I'm going with that. Okay, cool. This is part of the Harvard negotiation project. This particular edition was edited by Bruce Patton. I think he just basically went through and updated everything because this is a pretty old book like a lot of people have used this, but this was my book. I got to select the book this time around on our little audio book episode, but what did you think? After all, getting to yes, negotiating agreement without giving in. What's your overall reaction to the book? Thank you for listening to it, by the way. Oh, great recommendation. This was a ton of fun to listen to. It made me think about things that I don't normally think about. It confirmed some things that I already do intuitively and it embarrassed me on a bunch of other things that I do that I guess were intuitive, but not nearly as constructive. So I would say from a help me get better at life and help me observe the patterns of communication better point of view, it was wonderful from a cynicism point of view. I don't know that I liked the way the book made me feel. What do you mean? The jury's still out. This conversation is going to help shape how I feel about the book. Huh. Well, right in the introduction, they say this thing about, well, you know, we, this is the third edition or whatever. And early on, we made the case 20 some years ago when we first put this book out that everything is a negotiation. And immediately I started off on the wrong foot with them. I'm like, Oh, it's not. Come on. Don't be like that. That's what power brokers say. That's how people who wear ties with horizontal stripes think about the world. I know people who look at others and look at the world that way. And I don't like it. I find it off putting. And they went on to make the case that even things that aren't a negotiation are. I don't know. I feel like the premise bastardizes human relationships a little bit, but they softened me as the book went along. And whether I entirely am prepared to agree with the premise or not, the content therein was wildly useful, very well written, loaded with rich examples and very, very helpful. For me, my only hang up part is the entire premise. Oh, no. Okay. That is interesting to me because this was my book. I chose it. And maybe this comes down to like how I look at the world and how you look at the world because, for example, there's one thing that every organism does. And that's the oodle loop thing that we described earlier, right? Observe orient decide act. If you're an organism in a physical world, you have to like observe the world around you, whether that be through a chemical like signals or through optics with your eyes or whatever. And then you, you observe the world, then you orient yourself to that. Like, Oh, well, my, let's say if you're a single celled organism, like an amoeba or something, you're like, Oh, well, there is a gradient of salinity between here and there. I need to move towards that. Or there's more light on this side. I need to move. So every organism can be boiled down to like how their actions work in the world to an oodle loop. And I find that useful. It's like factoring polynomials down to their base levels. You know, you get things down to the atomic level almost. I find that useful myself. So when they started the book saying everything is a negotiation, I thought about that. And I was like, well, I mean, everything from where I'm going to eat for lunch. I mean, that's even an internal negotiation. Well, hey, do I want to eat lunch? What are my alternatives? All these types of things. And if you get another person involved in that, then some type of dare I say the word compromise or agreement has to be made. I looked at that and accepted it. And I actually agree with the premise of the book. I think it makes sense that everything you do at some point, you're going to make a decision and you're going to act on something. And unless you have total accord with everybody else around you, unless you're acting in a completely solitary fashion, you have to reach some type of agreement with other people in order to do the thing. Am I wrong at that? Maybe you might be. You might be right too. I'm still thinking about it. I genuinely am not coming to this conversation with my ultimate conclusion said in stone. I've waited to solidify my thoughts on this until I talk with you because I knew I knew this would be your read and I knew you'd be able to articulate it effectively. And you already are. That said, I felt like the book didn't take into account and even often poo-pooed the idea of altruism. No, I'm just going to sabotage this negotiation because I don't want to win. Like I'm running a completely different equation here. It did a great job of accounting for I need to win. It did a great job of accounting for equitability is found through each side taking a stance and then figuring out each other's needs and trying to do it. But at the very end, they make the remark about this book is not making a moral judgment. No. Moral judgments might be something to factor in. And here's ways that you should maybe consider factoring that in. But I think you can do an end run around negotiation if you do the truly selfless thing, which I wouldn't recommend all the time. I don't think that's equitable or always healthy, but I can think of situations where it isn't a negotiation and a decision is made because maybe you have already had an internal negotiation and you're like, everything about this decision is about the other person and it needs to be. And I want it to be. No, I think that's the premise of the book, right? I think a person can negotiate with another person for their own good. I mean, you know me well enough to know. Sometimes I will go try to convince a person to do something that only benefits them. I get made fun of a lot for doing this at times because of the way I come about it. But I think it is possible that that's the whole premise. It's principle based negotiation, not positional bargaining. That's the strongest point of the book and it's the thrust of the book and I don't take any exception to that. Well, my point is principle negotiation, like you don't have to reveal the principles upon what you're negotiating. So for example, if the principle that I have and I'm holding to be my north star in my whatever, let's say you have a young person, right? And they work at a certain location and you know that young person will stay in that job until they die. You know, I'm using hyperbole here, but let's say you see a person and you're like, hey, I would like you to go to school to learn this particular skill or trade. It's not in the best interest of you to spend time to invest in that person to get them to do that. But if you are negotiating with them about their own time, like, hey, you know, maybe you should do this. You've done this. I know you've done this. Like I've seen you do this. Of course I have. I'm letting you spell this out. But that was a negotiation skip to the end to give you my concluding point, which is, well, of course, yes, just that's not the only way. Of course you can negotiate with someone else entirely for their best interest as you perceive it. And you're masterful at that. I have watched you without any credit ever help so many people in so many ways that probably won't even occur to them until well after the fact. I love the way you craft and scheme for the benefit of others. And you know, full well, nobody's ever going to see it. And I just happen to be in close enough proximity to you as a friend that I see some of them. I've seen you do it too. Yeah. I'm not going to take away your, you know, ethereal reward for doing good by even being specific about it. But of course that's a negotiation. I'm not arguing that. What I am arguing is that I can imagine a human interaction meant for the good of someone else that isn't a negotiation, not that I can't imagine one that is absolutely you're absolutely right. I can just imagine stuff that isn't. I can imagine things where there aren't particularly strongly held bargaining positions or really any bargaining positions and just some sort of altruism happens. Help me understand. What do you, what do you mean by that? Can you give me an example? Um, yes, I can give you an example. And it's the only time I've been on the receiving end of a homelessness gesture. I was poor. I was in college. I was hungry. I didn't dress like somebody who was poor or hungry, but I was at a restaurant near the college that I went to. Whoever was there could tell that I looked like a poor college kid didn't know him. They didn't want credit. I just got a meal and that was it. And they came over and they're like, uh, hey, this one's on me. There was no negotiation. They didn't need to scheme to get me to accept it or anything. It just announced I'd like to pay for your meal. And that was it. Now, if you want to go super hard and be like, well, but you could have said, no, I get that point. I think we're just getting, we're deteriorating into semantics. I think when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And when the thing you think about all the time is negotiation, one might make the mistake of forcing all human interaction into the categories of negotiation when the more, when the healthier, more accurate thing to do might be to say many human interactions involve negotiation, but maybe not all. Wow. So that one word in the book turned you off at the beginning. Well, I think I'm being a little more level than that. I wouldn't say it turned me off. It's the thing that gave me pause. Yeah. But it's, it's fun for me to jab you with a stick when I get the opportunity. It's all right. You can continue to do so. It'll make this episode way more fun too. Yeah. No, but yes, Destin Wilson Sandlin. That word was too much and I won't have it. Table pound. Yeah. I mean, but you could also say things like, well, in that, in that case, when you were hungry or you may or may not have been hungry, in that case, your batma, your best alternative to negotiated agreement was not eat or, you know, you may have wanted to preserve your pride or whatever it is, you know, I've been in situations like that as well. I mean, you can always reject it. Yeah, I probably would take that position. Okay. So will you indulge a touch of dorky philosophical talk for just a second? Bring it. Yeah. I mean, I've already described myself as an amoeba across a salinity gradient. So go ahead. Okay. That's true. I'm owed. So the premise of modernism and by modern, when we talk about philosophy, we don't mean nowism. We mean an era that started roughly with the Protestant Reformation 1517 and included the scientific revolution. Francis Bacon, Descartes, that crowd, the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Thomas Jefferson, that crowd and industrialization. So 19th century up to most people would say that modernism dies or begins its death or goes into hospice right after World War II and the concentration camps are discovered. But in that period of time, both theologically and scientifically, everyone agreed on one premise. We can do better. We can answer the physical and abstract mysteries and questions of the world and humanity is improving and this increased theological governmental scientific knowledge will only make us better. And then two World Wars happened and then the concentration camps happened. And then the communist gulags and all of the death from the Soviet Union and China happened and the Americans dropped the bomb. And I know some people think that was the right call. I have hesitations about that. But you look at all of that death and chaos that it looks like our technology and progress only made us more equipped to do. And whether it's fair or not, global attitudes shift from one of 400 years of optimism to something much more skeptical about the human proposition. Now oddly, more than ever now, people think humans are inherently good. Whereas during modernism, people thought humans were inherently bad. It means I don't know why the modernist mind would be surprised that we would do horrible things to each other. And I don't know why the postmodern mind, the now mind would think we wouldn't do horrible things to each other. But that's a question for another day. That issue of the meta narrative, the big story that explains everything is one that modernists were very concerned with. If we understand relativity, that explains everything. That explains how everything fits together. You remember 321 contact on PBS? Contact is the reason it's what everything happens. Contact. Well, that's a modernist notion of a single narrative being the explanation for all things. Religious people have these science people have these religious science people have these. This was a very modernist idea. The heart of postmodernism has to do with the rejection, not of a meta narrative, but of meta narratives. There is not a single thing, says the postmodern mind, that explains all the things. That may be true. People can lean whichever way they want to lean on this particular question. But what struck me about this book is that it was very modernist in saying here is the reason the things happen. The word association makes the world go around. It's weird because I'm usually very sympathetic to modernist notions. In this case, it triggered my postmodernist skepticism. I heard that. I think there are 10 other meta narratives that we could throw out that would have just as good a claim to explaining everything as negotiation. Contact being one. Maybe that is where my hesitation comes in. Did you read it that way? I feel like they were saying that negotiation is the explanation for what makes the world go around and how people work or do you think I'm overstating that. I think you're overstating that. Basically, it's like the software that describes how two organisms interact. That was the way I read that statement. If you recall, the reason I picked this book is because of the article by Roger Fisher, one of the authors of this book that was about how to prevent nuclear war by embedding the nuclear codes in the chest of a young naval officer and the president would have to have a great discussion. That was the same guy that wrote this book. He is interested in arriving at complex creative solutions to very interesting problems. I did not read it anywhere close to the way you read that premise of the book because to me, this is just a good way to describe everyday interactions between two people or organizations that have principles that they like to adhere to but also want to move forward. I would say, so our Ben diagrams hugely overlap here. I would just allow a little more wiggle room and I would say this is a great guide for discussing something that often, maybe even most of the time, shapes human interaction but is not the only defining aspect of human interaction. And I am forced to reject that because of my position and we will not move forward on this discussion anymore. I really like what you did there. I'm taking my position and going home. Sorry. All right. So obviously this is a book episode and I think it's only appropriate to mention how we listen to the book, which also happens to be the sponsor for this episode, which is Audible. You can get a trial of Audible by going to audible.com slash in DQ or texting in DQ to 500 500 just on your phone. You pick up phone, create new text message just to the number 500 500 text the letters in DQ and a little link will pop up on your phone and that's it. You're in. It's that easy. I listen to Audible all the time. What about you, Matt? Yeah. Likewise. And so does my whole family now. Through credits, we're constantly getting new stuff. My kids are all powering through audio books left and right now too. So it's kind of fun that we have this shared account and I have to sift through things and I dang, the rest of my family, they are consuming audio books. They are growing. They are being exposed to new ideas and bigger words and bigger concepts. And so at first it was just me and now it's really become a family thing that we discuss. Yeah. I kind of like logging into my audible app and I just look in there and the library is huge because our little family library is just. I was like, whoa, I didn't download that. Yeah. And it's a book about the Civil War. What? What are my kids reading? It's really, really cool. So yeah, please consider going to check it out audible.com slash in DQ. They have this thing called the plus catalog. So you get one credit a month and you can use that credit on whatever book you want. And there's just tons of audible titles to choose from. I have a ton of things that I listen to, but they also have this thing called the plus catalog. And if you go to the audible plus catalog, you can get any of those books at any time for free. And they also have periodicals. They have podcasts. They have all kinds of stuff stories. Audible has anything you would ever want to list to. And it's going to help you cram stuff into your brain while you're doing other things like driving or running or working in the yard. You get to reclaim that time. It makes you even look forward to mundane things that otherwise make you sad. You picture them on the horizon and you're like, I have to do the thing. But when you are working through an audio book that you are enjoying and that makes your mind thrive, it's amazing. At least for me, my attitude flips to, yeah, I get to go do the thing. I get to go clean out and organize the garage because I'm going to power through a whole bunch more of ready player too, which is what I'm listening to now that we just finished up how to get to. Is it really? That's awesome. I just listened to a 37 hour audio book, dude. Let me see what's it called. It's the making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes. What's it about? Well, it's about this thing called the atomic bomb. Oh. But what's so crazy about it is it starts you way back in 1904 and it tells you where all the scientists were and what they were researching and how it led up to this ultimate thought like the atomic bomb existed in a person's brain and then how it went from that one thought to actual physical reality to ultimately being employed in war and the effects it had on the people that it was used on. It's an amazing book. The making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes. I loved it. But if you haven't listened to Getting to Yes, which is what this episode is about, I would highly recommend that because this is a very easy listen. I mean, it just, it goes down so smooth as you said. Well, and two of the things that I love about the audio book presentation is one, the dude who reads it really gets the book and the way it's read underscores the principles that are being communicated. Listening to this as an audio book will help you understand how to use it because the guy reading it illustrates it just in his tone of voice and his delivery. So that's very helpful. Yeah. The guy's name is Dennis Bootsa-Karis, I think is his name. He did a fantastic job on the reading performance. The other thing I really liked about it is the spatial organization. I was able to track with the outline so beautifully. They clearly crafted this book with the audio book in mind and what that would be like for a user consuming it the way I did. I was able to keep track of where we were in the flow of thought and argument very neatly. And so I feel like I can picture the structure of the book in my brain, which is very, very helpful. Another thing that I use on the app because the Audible app is amazing. I now have an Apple Watch for running and you can download the books to your Apple Watch. Oh my. Yeah, you can just run with the watch. You don't have to have a phone on you. It's amazing. But I use the backwards 30 second feature all the time because if there's a really deep concept that I didn't quite understand, I'll just go tap, tap, go back and I'll just digest that whole thought again. That's a really handy tool. Or if you get distracted for a second, tap, tap and then you get to re-digest like how they discovered what was the gain on the first nuclear reactor that happened in Chicago, that kind of stuff. You're making me think here. Everybody knows what it's like to look at a traditional bound paper book and to go on to autopilot mentally for a page or two pages. And you get to the end of that and you do the what just happened. And I will get caught in some kind of brain loop at times where I'll read the same text on a page four or five times and then I have to look at something else for a minute to just reset the mechanism because I'm not getting it. I just can't think about that page. But if I get distracted and I tap, tap to go back with an audio book, that does not happen. I get it on the next pass every time. Yeah. And that had not occurred to me until you said that. Yeah. Another thing you can do on the app is there's a clip feature where if there's just like a deep, deep thing where you're like, man, that was heavy at the bottom right on the iPhone app, there's a little thing that says plus clip. It's like putting a bookmark in a physical book and you can just make a little note to yourself. Like, for example, I could make one that says, Hey, tell Matt about the story about the land when I'm making actual notes about the book getting the yes, it's amazing. And they're your notes. You get to go back in your library and review those actual notes and it'll play the clip for you and then you can read what you wrote. It's really cool. Matt, you will save the URL one more time and just make sure the offer is very clear. Yep. You go to audible.com slash ndq or you're probably setting this up on a device at some point you can just text to the number 500 500 just text to the letters ndq. And then you're going to get your first audio book and full access to this whole plus catalog that Destin was talking about for free for 30 days. That's awesome. Thank you so much to audible for supporting the podcast and let's get back to negotiating about negotiating. Okay. So that little thing I did right before the ad break there where I took my ball and went home. Yeah, I missed you. That's like what it looks like when a negotiation breaks down. So how do you want to attack this? Let's actually go through some of the things that went through the book. If you're cool with that, absolutely. I'm excited to. And again, let me just make sure you understand this book benefited me and I think it's good and I'm glad everybody read it and I'm glad I read it. Great. Wonderful. Yeah. Okay. So don't take my pushback on the premise to be a rejection of everything we're about to discuss. It's not. No, your feelings are valued and you have been heard. Oh, wow. That's this had been going well. Oh, no, no, it's absolutely good. So how would you like to go through this book? Would you like to just go? I'm sure you took notes. I took notes. I listened to it twice. Likewise. Would you like to just point by point or how do you want to go through this? I think it'd be fun to talk about specific points in our lives when we've negotiated things. I'm sure you have notes on that. Yeah, they will come up as we go along. I'm sure. And I think that's one of the real strengths of the book is every time I was like, wait, I think I understand. But what would that look like? For example, like, Oh, hey, that was just great. Thank you. Yeah, I thought that was very powerful. I got so lulled into a rhythm by the narrator. And I don't think these guys read it. I think they had somebody else read it for them. But the person who read the book sounds exactly like the kind of person who should read this book. Oh, yeah. And it made me feel so chill as I listened to all the examples. It was like that is reasonable. The other party is reasonable. It was so neutral and calm. Even the way the reader read the book demonstrates that he understood it very deeply. And if he'd used all kinds of inflection that tipped his hand toward which side he thought made more sense in these examples, it would erect it. So there's an artistry to the reading that really made this thing go, I think. Yeah. And I actually thought that was an interesting point that was made later in the book that sometimes when you're doing a negotiation, well, let's just start here, for example, we can go back to the positional bargaining versus the principal negotiation. But I thought an interesting point that was made toward the end of the book was just the fact that people that negotiate face to face tend to arrive at an agreement that's more acceptable to both parties. Wasn't that something? As opposed to like a phone call or texts or something like that. Just that fact alone, I knew that and I felt that. But like having the data just thrown at you and be like, Oh, yeah, of course. And so that made me realize if I ever want to negotiate something, if I can physically get there or do some kind of video chat, we're actually looking at the person in the eye. I think that fact alone was immensely powerful. I think so too. And the fact that they had done their own research, I assume they were citing themselves to put numbers on it to give you actual data. That is so helpful to be able to visualize that a little bit. I was watching a video about trucks that do the automatic shut off at stoplights the other day. You know what I'm talking about? And your vehicle is still on, but the engine quits running to save fuel. And dude was talking about the advantages of it. He's like, Oh, people like to turn this off. It makes them nervous, makes them feel weird. And then he looks right into the camera and he's like, don't turn it off. 90 seconds at a stoplight costs this much fuel. And he holds up a little water bottle that's about one eighth, you know, one sixth full, something like that. And I was like, dang, really? That's like just dumping that much gas on the ground. Oh, I don't want to do that. Yeah, I'm definitely leaving that auto shut off in the on position so I can use it. And I had the same kind of epiphany moment as they're walking through the percentages of how effective these negotiations are depending on what medium you use to communicate. Oh, dang, I mean, it kind of squares with my experience, but you put data to it. Now I really believe it. Yeah, absolutely. I thought that was cool. So let's do this at the beginning. Let's just talk about positional bargaining versus principal negotiation. So I'm assuming that you do the thing I do. Like when you're in another country and you're learning the language, whether it be for me, Spanish or very poorly in German, I like to negotiate at an open air market. Sure. And it looks something like this. You walk up, you see a thing on the table, whether it's some type of, I don't know, pastry or if it's a pot or something like that, like something you want to take home to the ****. Yeah, exactly. If it's something like that. Yeah. So let's go with your thing though, like some sort of freshly baked bread. Yeah, exactly. So you have the thing there and you start in Spanish, you'd say how much? And then they give you a price and you say, no, that's too expensive. How about this much? And then you go back and forth and it takes a lot of time and you eventually meet somewhere in the middle. Or as you get better, they meet more towards your side. Or as you learn the market in the area, you learn that, oh, well, there's a guy a mile that way that sells them for a third of that. And so then you kind of understand the underpinning of the market and you can get to a much cheaper price. But the seller knows that you have to go to that mile away market to get it at that price. So there is value for them having it here. And so there's something about that that happens. It's really interesting. It gets it to where you can learn the inflection of the language that you're working in. You've done this, right? Africa, I assume. Yeah. Well, almost everywhere I've negotiated in Africa has been in English except for Equatorial Guinea, which is more of a Spanish, Spain, Spanish. So for the most part, my negotiations on that continent have been pretty easy because we're all speaking the same language. But in Latin America or in Italy, yeah, I'm at a big disadvantage and I have to reduce all of this down to its rudimentary negotiating parts. Yeah. So the book makes the claim that this positional bargaining where I'm going to establish myself here, I'm going to set an anchor at one side of the number line and they're going to set an anchor at the other side of the number line. And then we're just going to like move back and forth verbally until we arrive at somewhere that we can both, you know, we span that chasm in between us. That is one way to negotiate and it's effective. It like it, it works. But I don't know, it lends to mistrust because if I want to quote, win, one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to anchor really low if I want to get this thing for a good price. And it makes the seller anchor really high. I actually did this. There was a URL that I'm interested in and it said, Hey, click here to make an offer. And so I made an offer for the URL. I was like, Hey, I think it's to be worth like 500 bucks. No joke. This is the exact response I got from the little web service or whatever. It's like, Hey, this is Albert. Yeah, so you're off. So at this time, we are entertained. I'm just going to read it to you. Respond. Okay. To do counter offer. Confirm your offer. Let's see. You don't have this URL yet? No, I do not have the URL open. I was just, I was just interested in it. And so here we go. Okay. So this is the one you were telling about. This is Destin smoking hot. Yeah, that's the one. That's the exact one. And so this guy says, Hey, thanks for your offer. I'm going to say $500 at this time, we are only entertaining offers at $48,888. And I said, the response to that is I said, Oh, well, thank you very much. The highest I would be willing to give is $2,000. And they came back like, Oh, okay. Well, thank you for leaving the lines of communication open. You know, I will match your willingness to increase your price by my willingness to decrease my price to the very low price of $33,400 or paid over a year, $2,700 a month. You know, at this point, I'm just kind of entertained, right? I'm just like, wow, there's a very, very deep chasm in between us. And I don't think this will be spanned in any reasonable way. And so I was listening to this book at that moment, like when I was doing this and I'm like, Oh, wow, we are in positional bargaining right now. This is just not going to work. And I'm certainly not going to come out ahead. Okay. So the principal negotiation that the authors of the book put forward has really opened my eyes to many different things that are possible. Like you can be creative with an agreement and stuff like that. Can you give me an example of a time in your life where somebody's wanting to get into a positional bargaining situation, but you took them to a principal based negotiation? Yes, absolutely. But before we do, let's make sure the third chair is with us on this. Because this is the thesis of the book, their whole technique that was celebrated at a couple of points in the book with massive negotiating breakthroughs, some of which I'd even heard of those breakthroughs were credited to making this mental pivot on how you negotiate and this exact school of thought on negotiation. So this is a big deal. What is held out in this book, the thesis of the book is your run of the mill lazy, normal negotiating approach is competitive. It usually involves two anchored positions like you just described over gathering this URL and the two sides just fire back only one dimensional arguments. I want this while I want this while I want this while I want this I could go this far. I could go that far. And the book opens with an example of somebody trying to buy a pot or a brass bowl or something in an antique shop and it never even gets to resolution. And the example you can just imagine this would go on ad nauseum with both sides blustering and posturing about, well, I could never know. Look at the engraving. It just has too much. So they hold this out and do a good job of characterizing it as being ineffective, but also the default setting of most human negotiation, unless you think critically about it and willfully and intentionally abandon this position based bargaining and move to principal based bargaining, which looks like what? Now, basically you figure out what the other side wants. Like if you can put yourself in the position of the other person, I mean, the trick is essentially empathy, but if you also know what you want, probably the best example in the book that I felt really characterized the whole principal negotiation thing was the example of the construction company that had really fast trucks moving up and down the streets. The people that lived in the neighborhood did not want these trucks moving up and down the streets because their children were in danger when the children would play outside. And so instead of saying, Hey, I need you to stop your trucks moving up and down the street. The person that was negotiating on behalf of the neighborhood said something along the lines of, well, you have children, don't you? You know, you open with something like that. Or does your company adhere to the OSHA safety standards that are accepted by industry? You know, they said a couple of things along those lines and it implied like, Hey, this person on the other side of the table is of goodwill and they're intelligent and they want to solve the problem too, because if one of the trucks hits one of our children, I mean, that's bad for everybody, especially the child, obviously, but like that could be horrible for the company. And so that very act in itself empathizing with the other person and one very real way to do this that I thought was very interesting. And I've actually used this since reading the book is if you're trying to work a problem out, physically sit on the same side of the table with the person that you're trying to work this out with and look at the problem, like if you have a whiteboard in front of you and say, Hey, this is our problem. We're trying to figure this problem out and you write it down in some way. How can we together work on that? And so it removes that, well, this I'm on this side of the table and that side of the table and we are clearly in conflict. If you can remove the conflict and just get down to the principle that you're each are trying to adhere to and work together on that solution, it sounds simple, but that was groundbreaking, right? Yeah. It's huge. The piece that makes a ton of sense. You have position number one is positional bargaining and that is we each pick an anchor point. We focus on what we each want to get. And then without ever considering what the other one wants to get, we just negotiate, which makes the other person the problem instead of making getting to yes, the problem. We need to get to yes together. Let's figure out how to do it. Whereas what you are describing the principled bargaining approach being, it makes the other person, the ally and the question before us is the problem and we're going to workshop it and see if we can figure that out. And in order to work well with your ally, you need to understand your ally's interests as you both come at the problem together and they need to understand yours. Is that a decent summary of what you just said? No, well, kind of. I want to modify one thing you said. This is a specific strategy within principled negotiation. You can engage in principled negotiation with a hostile party. You can have a principled negotiation technique with someone who is angry, for example. Sure. And capitalists can try to defeat Hitler with communists. I mean, yes, you definitely. Yes. We have huge examples of that happening, but we agreed the problem was Hitler, right? Well, I'm thinking on a much smaller level than you. I mean, you're thinking in a much bigger terms than I am, but I can remember a specific meeting I was in. And the individual that we were negotiating with, this was a big contract having to do with military vehicles and putting a specific type of hardware on all these vehicles. And this individual worked at that company. I remember this individual clutching their fist and physically hitting the table and saying a thing really loud, like, I don't blah, blah, blah, blah. So you are talking about the communism thing. You're talking about Chris, Jeff? No, I'm not. Oh, you didn't have a meeting with Chris. I did not know this individual. This was like, you know, we were all Americans and we were all having this discussion, but this person had this thing that they were really, really mad about. And I remember looking at the person screaming and pounding, literally pounding your fist on the table. And I remember cutting my eyes to my friend in the room. And we both like kind of giggled with our eyes, if that makes any sense. And we realized like what he said just then doesn't matter. Like he may have well said, I want to smash my hand on the table because I'm angry. He may have well said that. But in the moment we realized that we're like, OK, cool. That was just emotion. That had nothing to do with anything. What matters is this. And we've got back to the principal and we figured out how to turn that around. But we didn't dismiss what he was feeling. He had that feeling and there were reasons he had that feeling. And we didn't say, Hey, you're stupid. Calm down, idiot. We didn't say that. We were like, yeah, Mr. X. I understand you feel that way. So how do you think we can get to this position? You know what I mean? How do you think we can get around to this solution? And so there were other techniques in the book like that. Like listen to emotional outburst, just the fact that you listen to the emotional outburst and you don't interrupt the person. That's amazing. The fact that you can not affirm what they're saying is true, but affirm the way they feel. That was interesting. That lets the other side know that they've been heard, but you don't have to agree with them. You can let them say their thing and it cost you nothing. I thought those little tips like that were super, super powerful because that makes the people feel like they can trust you because they can because they can be vulnerable and they can tell you how they feel. And it might boil down to something not going great at home. You know, they might be having a hard time at the house. And this is the one thing they feel like they have control over. And if you can somehow break through that hard outer shell and get to the actual human beneath and as the book puts it, separate the people from the problem and just give the person what they need, not what they're asking you for, but like figure out what they truly need, which is, hey, I need to look powerful in front of my constituents. You know, I need to make rent, whatever it is. I thought that was powerful. I thought so too. And I think you said that really well. I'm not understanding how that's different than how I characterized it. And so I think I maybe derailed you and you didn't have a chance to get to the point of distinction you wanted to make. So the only thing I was clarifying is that principled negotiation can take many forms. It doesn't have to take the one form where you're both on the same side of the table. There was a slip of the tongue in there somewhere. I was just saying that you can also have principled negotiation with a hostile party. Sure. Yeah. And I think you can also sit on the same side of the table as a hostile party. It's weird. Yeah, but it's disarming. I would agree. It's also kind of fun. Well, it's such a different gesture or set of gestures. You have at your disposal when you're sitting next to the person who doesn't like you, then you have at your disposal when you're sitting across from the person who doesn't like you. The same exact open hand gesture directed across the table feels like a four-fingered point. Whereas if you just open that to your right, just here, actually try it, you open that to your right. It feels like you're being deferential. Right. You need to, well, my friend here makes the point. It's the same exact hand motion. It's just whether you thrust it forward or open it to the side. Those things are subtle. You get the Marine Corps drill sergeant knife hand in one direction. And then you have like this gesture of openness in the other. Yes. Yeah. Have you ever participated in an international negotiation? Like, hey, no, I have actually. I've been a an ambassador for the country before. I've done that. I was a member of a group for a long time called International Test Operational Procedures. And I top as what was called. And it was an agreement, a memorandum of understanding written in 1985 between the nations of the US, Germany, UK and France. Basically, it went like this. Hey, we're going to test these rockets. And let's say, for example, France made some rockets and America wanted to buy them. Well, America has certain test standards and France has certain test standards. And often those standards are different. For example, America might have to test the rocket down to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit and plus 140 degrees Fahrenheit, where France might want to test them only down to minus 25 C or something like that. And so this group I was a part of, I did it for 15 years. We would meet in a different country. I hosted the meeting twice. We would all go together twice a year and we would sit at a table and we would negotiate on how to test certain things. And we would argue for hours over the word will versus shall or may versus will. All of those things we would work out together. And we did some pretty big things. Like I authored about five international agreements between specifically the US, the UK and Germany. It's pretty cool because at the end, there's a document that's got the nation's flags on the top and you wrote it and diplomats sign it and you're like, wow, that was interesting. You know, and it, it pertains to a very specific nitnoid level thing. Like it's a very small sliver of agreement between two countries. But you learn that the fewer people that are at the table, the easier it is to arrive in an agreement. For example, the UK didn't send diplomats for a while and France had some people out for different reasons, the UK, you know, lacked funding for whatever reason. And so when it was just the US and Germany at the table, we had so many documents that were written because the area of the Venn diagram was a little bit bigger, but our sister organization, what's called Stenag standard NATO agreements that had all of the nations of NATO in there. Their agreements were so broad because there were so many cooks in the kitchen that you couldn't actually create a meaningful document because by the time it was something everyone would accept, the document basically meant nothing. And so one technique that we would do is we would go meet as an ITOP group. We would negotiate this stuff. And then after we arrived at an agreement, sometimes the Stenag people would be like, Hey, do you guys want to cover sheet the ITOP agreement? Meaning, hey, they did the hard work of coming up with an agreement. And if this is good enough for the US and Germany, do we want to do it as well? Sure. Let's put our cover page on it and let's all sign it. Whoever, whatever nation wants to ratify this, they can. But what I learned more than anything is the personal relationships with my counterpart in Germany was the most important thing, period. Once we could trust each other, it was amazing because we could actually have super complex discussions on how do we test a laser at a test facility without shooting it into space on accident? You know, the Germans, they like the deterministic versus the probabilistic approach. Um, you know, and how do you test a flight termination device in a way that would be accepted by the German safety guys? So once we arrived at, Hey, your name is Klaus and I'm going to go to your house and we're going to play ping pong after the meeting tonight, which happened, you're just in a completely different place. You trust each other. And it's amazing. That's kind of like the example of the Russian diplomat and the diplomat from the UK that the book included where the Russian diplomat asked for more time and the guy from the UK balked and the Russian diplomat said, you're not understanding me. I'm asking you personally to give me more time. And then the guy from the UK in the example in the book was like, Oh, oh, I get it. And so he granted more time and the result was a wonderful outcome for everyone. I saw that happen many, many times. Like we would do silly things like, Hey, we're going to meet for four days. And on the fifth day, we're going to go on a tour of a local facility together. And then we're going to go eat at this restaurant that this guy likes. It seemed like it was a goof off day, but it was not a goof off day because nope, that was the day I met this person's children. Or this is the day they came to my house and we shot guns together. You know what I mean? It was amazing. It was fantastic. I remember sitting at a German guy's house and he had such command of the English language. The only word we had to look up that day was pomegranate because he didn't know how to say pomegranate in English. I was very impressed. I don't know. I looked showing. I thought it was amazing and it was a, it was a huge, I matured a tremendous amount in the world grew for me by meeting those people, my counterparts in the UK and all that. It was such a formative thing for me. And I'm so very blessed to have had the opportunity to do that at such a young age. Hearing you tell that story and connecting the dots with how I've seen you negotiate and we've negotiated together, I've seen us do things intuitively while we are in the same room that are recommended by this book. I've seen us do things that are not condemned as being immoral or unethical, but that just aren't like, no, that might not be the most effective. I've seen us get things right. I've seen us fumble a little bit and trying to say what we meant to say as well as we could have said it, but we've had several, just little rather inconsequential negotiations. You and I were becoming away and we're like, Hey, cool. That went well. And what those all have in common is what you're describing, you learned at a young age doing these negotiations internationally. That being there was some kind of banked equity to draw on that we were able to bring to the conversation or that the other party was able to bring to the conversation. And that banked equity is huge. See it in church. You asked, for examples, I don't know, a while back here of times that I have engaged in negotiations, I can think of a couple. One is not so much a negotiation, but just a way of thinking through or wrestling through ideas together. Early on in my time doing church, I noticed that the orientation of a church sanctuary with wise versus lengthwise means something different and seems to accomplish different things. Really? Sure. The higher the church, the more vertical or long the orientation of the church itself. I mean, think about it. When you picture a Catholic cathedral, which is an expression of Christianity that is very top down, is it wide or is it long? It's long, meaning there's more chairs further away from the pulpit. Yes. Whoever is speaking is on the short leg of the rectangle, not on the long leg. Right. Now you picture your very low church bedazzled jeans, worship band, smoke and lasers kind of like very low non-denominational church. Is it longer? Is it wide? It's wide. And sometimes it's even like an amphitheater feel where it's around the center. Mm hmm. What does that mean? You want people to be able to see each other. So I've been a part of multiple church building projects very early in the game. I became convinced that stuff means stuff. This was maybe my first ever life epiphany, my first ever tautology as a person who's trying to think about stuff and make sense of the world. And this idea that everything means something stuff means stuff is something that started to become important to me as I went and looked at churches as a young man. I figured out really quickly the orientation of a church means something. It communicates theology. And it should. And so if you have a Catholic church that's incredibly wide and there are exceptions, you see that every now and then, you know, hey, great. Give it a try. It could be cool. I bet you that that Catholic church though is going to feel more low churchy than a traditional or traditionally oriented Catholic church. So then when I do these building projects, one of the big questions that I've encouraged my teams to think through with me is who are we theologically? What kind of organization are we and how could the orientation of our church communicate and help our theology instead of be something that we have to work against? And so every project I've been a part of has been wide instead of long in terms of the way the orientation works. Why? Because I want to reduce the authority of the person up front, me. And I want to increase the sense of we do this as a community. We put all of our processors on this. We can see the other half of the room as we sit and worship and participate in this stuff together. And because I wanted to give the impression that we have a problem, maybe problem is overstating it. I'm trying to use the language of this book. And the problem is that we all suspect that there is some divinity behind all of this, that there is something transcendent and profound about human existence, about existence in general, and that there's a starting point for all of this, that being a God. I know not everybody in the third chair sees it the same way as me. I five total respect. You don't have to come at this the same way as me, but I think you're understanding where I'm coming from here. And that is that's a very big question. And so should I as a 35 year old last time I worked on a building project, whatever I was, should we build the whole thing around how smart I am and how much I know in my infinite wisdom, having been a full fledged adult for 14 whole years now? Well, no, I don't think so. I like the idea of communicating the optimism of people sincerely pursuing this are going to sit on the same side of the table and look at the question together and workshop it together. When we got to that part about principled bargaining that involved sitting on the same side of the table, I know it's not exactly a negotiation per se, but that's what it made me think of in terms of things that I've observed and tried to implement along the way. I think in many, in many ways, what you're doing in that situation is far more difficult. Like I know several pastors or community leaders, things of that nature and the stress that they feel because they are trying to please so many people. And you'll see a pastor, if you get to know him and you talk to him, they'll say, Hey, man, I want to do this, but I can't because that'll offend this group of people or I want to do that because it'll offend that group of people. You see this play out like at schools, you see all this. So in many ways, if you ever get to the place where it's just like two people have to agree on a thing, it gets really, really easy. But the more people you have to negotiate with, that's horrible. That's hard. So, but then the buy in is off the charts. What do you mean? Well, let's say we're having a disagreement between the congregation as a whole and the leadership team of the church, something I've never experienced. But let's say that was happening. That's pretty bad. That's a big deal. That means that the entire future of the institution is in jeopardy. Well, let's say that we're having that disagreement and I sit down as the leader of the leadership of the church with one representative of the whole congregation who disagrees about which way we should go and we begin to engage in negotiations. Let's say we finally come to some sort of conclusion. Is that very broad congregation going to accept what that one individual comes back and says, well, and we worked it out, we did this. Well, no, that's not as likely because there are a whole lot of reasons that different people have for coming to the position that might bring them together in name, but they all got there in different ways. And I don't think there is likely to feel like their reason for how they got there was addressed or considered if the negotiations happen to behind closed doors. Plus it's going to be very difficult for me to go back and sell that to my entire leadership team. Whereas in an institution like a church, there is some advantage in certain circumstances to putting everybody in a room and setting some ground rules for how we talk to each other and what we're doing. I've been a part of a meeting like that that I did not lead as a lower ranking. Well, very low ranking pastor on a staff. The ground rules weren't put in place. The thing melted down into a Jerry Springer episode. One half of the room says something, half of the room cheers. The other half booze. The other half of the room says something that half cheers. The other one booze. I mean, it was ugly and that church struggled after that meeting. So I've seen it go wrong, but I've also seen leaders put down parameters for how we're going to talk to each other, how we're going to do this thing. Yes. Remember, here's the goal. Here's the objective. The people sitting around you like you give the reasons first. Yes. This is what they talked about in the book. They said you want to give your interest in reasoning first before suggesting the fixes. So they said like, Hey, we know that we want to be unified at the end of this. And we also want these things to happen, whatever it is. Like we have this problem that we need to address together. If you agree on the ground rules before you start the negotiation, it's much more likely to turn out well, I'm assuming you think. Yeah. And it exposes manipulation to everyone. I mean, in that kind of setting, if there's an nefarious actor who is using flowery religious language, well, I just want to do the right thing. And I'm concerned that some folks around here are just not taking the Bible seriously enough. Well, that sounds really righteous and holy. But if you all agree together, all sides on what we're going for as a group, as a congregation and everybody's like, yep, that is what we're doing. And we have two different views for how to achieve it. And then somebody comes out and is a bad actor and they've been a driving force and the whole thing. Everybody gets to see really quickly, Oh, well, those aren't the agreed upon goals. You have a different set of goals than everybody else on both sides. You're doing your own thing. You're the crapster right there. It's you. And so one other advantage in this kind of big group decision making setup of patiently expressing the value of all parties and then working through the values of all parties and what we're going for is that it becomes much easier to detect the person who really is doing their own thing and isn't going for the agreed upon point of what the institution is driving at. I don't know, man, I've led a ton of meetings and churches. When they go well, it just feels incredible. And when they don't, I can tell you whose fault it is mine. I'm the one leading this negotiation. If somebody acts like a turd and I can't figure out how to steer that or make something good come out of it, it's on me. So it's a pretty high pressure thing. It's not international trade negotiations or weapons testing or defense systems testing negotiations by any stretch of the imagination. But I think I can understand it a tiny bit of what you're talking about. Oh, but I mean, all of these principles apply whether you're talking about weapons that kill people or, you know, scripture that heals people. Like if you're, if you're a group of people working on a certain thing, all of these negotiation things apply, which is why I found this so interesting. Yeah. Can I tell you a couple of specific things that happened in my life and now looking back, tell you kind of what I got right and what I got wrong? Is that cool? Yeah, let's swap a few of those. Go for it. OK, I'll start with the first one. OK. I was a very young man. Did not have a tremendous amount of discretionary income coming into the family. I had to drive back and forth over two hours on the road every day. My wife was doing the same thing. We, we live between two cities really far away and we kind of split the difference in terms of distance and we had to have a reliable vehicle. At the time I had a V8 truck that was just burning the gas and just burning all of our money away. And so I needed a vehicle that was smaller that would get better gas mileage. OK. So I had two options. I found one that was a like a 1994 escort that was kept by an engineer and he had every receipt for every oil change he'd ever made in four years. It was a four cylinder. It was an automatic. It was it was a fantastic purchase to save gas. But it was an escort, but it was a four-deskort. Yeah, I mean, it was the right choice looking back with my adult brain. However, it's funny. Is that name made sense as something you would want to call your vehicle in 1990. So the second option was a 1987 Toyota Supra with a six cylinder with a stick shift and a little decal in the back that says turbo. And so I went to, you know, I called both of them. And same day I went and looked at both of them. And I, I, I've already told the story once before, but what I didn't tell about the, the Supra, which I ended up purchasing and ended up blowing up on the way home. I didn't tell you this one little thing that happened. So in the, in the book, they talk about a baton, a best alternative to negotiated agreement. Yes. And in the moment when I went to see the Supra, the gentleman was in his driveway. You know, hands on hips looking at his Supra. And there was another guy talking to him. And I pulled up and like, Hey, Mr. Jones, I'm Destin. I'm here to look at the car like we discussed on the phone. He's like, Oh, okay. Cool. Destin. And I introduced myself to the man beside him. Hey, I'm, I'm Destin. What's your name is like? Oh, I'm, I'm Joe. What's his name? Um, yeah. I called about the car too. And, uh, but he tells me that you called first. So you get first crack at it. So see what you think. And so instantly I'm like, okay, if I don't buy the car, he's going to sell it immediately. So I have very low power in terms of negotiation here, right? He's got a number that he wants. 800 bucks or whatever it was. I need to buy it. If I want it, that's my option, right? So test drove the car. It's missing a little bit. I think I can fix it a little low on compression on one of the cylinders. And I made a decision in a very quick moment because this guy had an alternative sitting there right in front of me. His alternative was, Hey, um, Joe here is going to buy it. If you don't, was it real or did he bring Joe in? See, I was too dumb to know, Matt. And so I think it's possible that Joe might have been his next door neighbor, but he might have been. I was so naive and so young and so nervous. And I really liked the word turbo on the back. I just didn't think all that through. And I didn't think about the fact that there might be another Toyota super out there in the state of Alabama. So, uh, yeah, yeah, I bought it from him. Uh, and you know, one of the cylinders just blew out on the way home. And I never drove it once I got home. Like I ended up losing so much money on that. And it was because I was a poor negotiator and I got excited. And I just wanted to reveal to you that his batna, his alternative to a negotiated agreement was sitting there, staring me in the face. And not only was I so bad at not recognizing I had a batna, I let his influence my decision. Like it's so dumb that I did that, but I did. And I learned from the mistake your turn. Yeah. Yeah, that batna thing comes in about the halfway point of the book and it is absolutely crucial to put a term on that. Now, remind me again, the acronym is best available, best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Yes, alternative to it. I understand the principle. I could never remember the initialism. I got it. So basically, if I don't make this deal right now, I can walk away and do X, Y, Z or, you know, like, Hey, I could buy this thing from you or I could go to this other place and, you know, instead of the Chevy, I could buy a Ford, you know, it's an alternative that you had as an exit. It's like pulling the ejection seat handle and your jet. Yeah. Okay. I had a negotiation a while back on a house that I purchased. This was a negotiation that was going down as you and I were recording, whatever episode that was where you laughed your butt off about Costa Rica and trying to sell crabs for colonists. And I was talking about not being a pastor anymore. Well, as that's happening, I'm trying to sell the house I was in in one place. And I'm trying to buy a different house. Very stressful. I was very stressful. The transition was very stressful. I've always done something on the side as well as be a pastor, academic stuff, writing stuff, YouTube stuff, whatever. But still it's a very identity forming job. And this move for me was not just, I need to go to a different place and live and get a new job. No, it was going to do internet things and try my hand at all of this. What I needed was a social reset, not from anything. My circle of friends, the people I went to church with and worked with, they were great, just wonderful relationships. But your pastor, you occupy a weird, weird social role in a community, especially if you're the pastor of, I'm probably the biggest church in the county in a small town, like that sticks with you. And it was like that when I got there. So, yeah, I'm not saying like I've made anything cool or whatever. So I played this weird role for a long time. This move meant something to me. It was a reset, a needed reset. I wanted to go to Walden. I wanted to go to the pond. I wanted to go to the fly fishing water in the mountains in a cabin. I wanted to burn wood and plow snow and wear lumberjack outfits and grow my beard very thick and be just a little bit on the fringes of society for a while and try to remember what it's like to relate to people when you're not in this counseling pastoral role. And so I had this whole thing knitted together in my brain for how it needed to look. Well, we negotiate a deal on this cabin, beautiful cabin. It's in a place that was really affordable at the time. It was crazy that we could afford something like that in almost any other market other than where we bought it. It'd be so far out of reach. But, you know, it was banged up. It wasn't particularly well cared for by the previous owner, but everything was fixable and I was like, let's do it. So we worked out a deal and I pretty carefully negotiated the deal on like, hey, these basic things need to be cleaned up. It needs to be in presentable condition when we take over and then we'll do the fix in. We got toward closing. My realtor did not follow through as an out of town purchase, didn't follow through, didn't go up, didn't check on things. And so we went for the walkthrough right before we closed on the place and it's a dump. They didn't clean anything. Like none of the things that you had agreed on, were they in a contract? They were in a contract. Like they had to do the stuff that we agreed on and they just did not do it. One of the things was there was damage to a deck on the north side of the house. I was like, Hey, you got to stabilize that deck and fix it. Well, they ran like 10 simple drywall screws through the deck on the south side of the house. And then when we called them on it, they were like, weren't sure what side you meant. Well, the one on the north side, like right here in the contract, do you know which way north is? It was that level of ineptitude. So we get to this new house that we just bought that to me is representative of, wait, wait, wait, you went through, you went through with the purchase? Oh, well, no, that we are in the process of buying. We go to this house that we're in the process of buying for the walk through a couple hours before closing. We just rolled into town and there's food in the sink. There are bags of trash. Like they took their bags of trash and just dumped them down the Aspen and pine covered slope off of the north deck. They just dumped their trash off the deck. What are you doing? They left their food in the sink. Stuff's a mess throughout the house. All of their construction junk is left scattered around the property. I was like, we established all of this would be gone. All of this waste, wood and construction material. I mean, what are we doing here? So we went back into town. I was like, yeah, I'm not going to close. Well, everybody starts freaking out. Well, the sellers have to close on their new property half an hour after you close with them. Well, they did not honor the contract. We made a deal and we negotiated it very carefully. Everybody agreed to it and then they didn't do the things they said. I didn't agree to that number for the house in this condition. I agreed to it for the house and the condition that we agreed upon. And so I just left. I just walked away from closing. I was like, no, I can't do it. And I went and I sat at a Cudoba and I ate and just figured my phone will ring. Then it did. And here come the apologies and the offers. And I was like, I mean, this is thousands of dollars worth of stuff. I just have to absorb on the front end. No, I'm still out. I'm sorry. You did not order the contract. So your bat now was great. Like your alternative was I don't have to buy this house. So you had a very strong negotiating position in that moment. Yeah. Yeah, it was great. And it was very, very helpful in terms of positioning. And so they made concessions. They made more concessions. They made more concessions. And ultimately what we ended up with is you're going to financially compensate me for all the things I now have to do. And you're going to come up to the house and you're going to clean up all the messes we agreed to. Like you are going to do it and then we will sign. And ultimately the seller wouldn't do it. Like, nope, I'm not cleaning up my messes. Just wouldn't do it. So we're realtors were so invested and so wanted that payoff that they both agreed to come up. They both kicked in money to cover what the seller owed to straighten out what they backed out on what they didn't do. And so the realtors, they ate it. They clean up, they cleaned the property, they hauled away all the junk. And, you know, it, that makes sense. It's on them. It was their job to make sure that all of the stipulations of the contract were followed through on and they both failed to do so. And so in the end, I close on the property and it was a difficult property. There was a lot of work that needed to be done. But as I think back on it, what I think I could have done way better is instead of just digging in and doing the ha ha, I stubbornly am not going to cooperate with this because I have a contract and I'm in the right. I think I did a little bit more of the Jonathan Hite righteous mind routine and didn't feel like I needed to be empathetic. But if I had introduced empathy into the negotiation, I think it would have sat better for everybody. Ultimately, I sold the property and I did not go with the realtor I worked with before. Nice guy. But I was like, hey, we botched the transaction. I don't want to work with you again. And that offended him and he called told me in tone as much. He was cool about it. So in the end, I could have made things better for both realtors, the title company, the seller and my family, if I had introduced empathy into the equation, by coming back and saying, look, here's what I sense you're needing. I sense that you bought this property years ago with your spouse. And then my understanding is that at some point along the way, your spouse passed away. Maybe it was their dream, not your dream. And so for you getting rid of this and just washing your hands of it means something for me, moving from where I've been into this cabin and having it be something that feels optimistic and like a step towards something means something to me. Now we've had a couple of problems with our contract and it's messing with both of our dreams, our emotional needs connected to this thing. And I think that stuff is real. And I think if I had done that and brought people to the table to figure that out, I think there would have been a softening effect. I think I could have demonstrated empathy. I think they would have understood what I was coming from. And my negotiation would have felt less scorched to earth in the end. We got the things we wanted. They got the things they wanted. She did a little jig out in the parking lot when she sold the place with her realtor. So, you know, it was okay, but it felt more scorched earth than I would usually like to go. And I would love a mulligan on that transaction. That's an interesting point because they said one of the techniques that they recommended is at the end of a transaction, like if you're negotiating with another party, this is at the very end, if you can hold something in reserve that you know the other party wants and you can extend it to the other party as a good will gesture, even if it doesn't cost you anything. But if it's like this one, like, for example, hey, we can do this and you don't have to move out until next Thursday or something like that. Right. Take your time moving your stuff out or something along those lines, then that can help ensure that the other party will honor the negotiated principles or what not principles, but honor, honor what you say they'll do. Um, so I thought that was interesting as well. Yeah, that Mrs. Jones apartment rent control anecdote that they shared at probably the three quarter mark of the book. That's what made me think of this. I hadn't thought about my mistakes in dealing with that negotiation over the cabin until I got to that part. And then I was like, Hmm, I don't look totally good here. I could have done a lot better. And what really struck me the moment they got me is when I think the landlady and that story's name was Mrs. Jones, if I'm wrong, that's a good generic name anyway. But the point where Mrs. Jones gets mad in one of the examples and she gets indignant and a little bit accusatory and you can feel the renters amp up a little bit and then they calm down. They ask questions. They reframe it. They make sure they understand her position and they reframe the entire negotiation. That is where I got it wrong. Again, the outcomes might have been fine, but I still don't feel fine about it. And I know other people still don't feel fine about it. And I could have made that better if I'd read this book two years sooner and taken my cues from that example. Yeah. I think the reframing thing was super, super powerful. I only have one other thing that I wanted to mention that I should have known this before. I did not know about the technique of what like if two children want to split a cake, one child cuts the cake and the other child chooses the piece. Yeah. Really? You didn't do that growing up? No, I've never heard that. It was amazing. So, so I actually had a situation where some close family members had a piece of land that was inherited and they could not figure out how to split the land, the person that left the land to them and there was a house and land. They just could not figure out how to split it. It was just sitting there for years and nobody was using it. And I was like, this is wrong. And so I came up with this plan where I got an aerial map of the property and it was a significant amount of land. And then I went to the courthouse and I asked what the going rate for land in that area was. And I said, hey, how much per acre are people getting in that area? And they're like, oh, this much per acre. I was like, okay, how much does a house like this worth? And they gave me a number. And I said, okay, well, here's an interesting thing we can do. So I got an aerial print. This is before Google Earth, an aerial photo of the property. And I drew a square on the property that encompassed two borders, like the left side and the top side, for example, and it has a house on it. And I said, okay, if you draw a square, over in the corner of the square touches this line and I drew a diagonal across the property. And so you could draw this rectangle. However you wanted, and I worked out a little equation where the house plus the area inside the rectangle is equal to the value of the land outside the rectangle. Does that make sense? Yes. It's hard, hard to imagine. But basically I let one person draw the rectangle and then I let the other person choose. And so I was just trying to get him to the table. And so I was like, Hey, what if you do this? You know, what would be a good place to make the border of the land with the house? What do you think? And then one person said a thing and the next person said a thing. I was like, Oh, okay. So we agree that where the old fence used to be makes a lot of sense. And so that would make it go back this far on the property. And then that would be, okay, look, that's this many acres equals this many acres plus the house. And I was able to get them to the table and I was eventually able to get them to agree on who gets what. But it happened at the, like they actually walked into the lawyer's office and they were drawing up the deeds. And in the last moment, one of the parties changed their mind. They said, I want this. I want the house in the land. And at the last moment they changed their mind and said, no, no, no, I decided it's one of the bad practices they described in the book. What do you mean? Well, at the end, remember they had the little appendix where they went through a series of questions and they're like, how do you respond in good faith to bad practice negotiation? And that was one of the bad practices they mentioned. Exactly. And so it was clear to me that one of the parties was negotiating in bad faith and one was negotiating in good faith. And the one that was negotiating good faith was clever enough to say, this actually happened. They told the lawyer, they said, Hey, this is what they're saying they want. My name on this deed and their, their name on that deed. Go ahead and write both deeds up where they get both, you know, the other side and the lawyer, this actually happened. The lawyer said, well, that's dumb. They're saying they want this. And he said, go ahead and write it up. He said, dude, that's going to be 500 extra bucks. He said, just do it. And the lawyer said, okay, well, I'll make a deal with you. If they change their mind in the last minute like that, then I'll waive the $500 and do it for free. And they said, okay, do it. And it ended up happening in the lawyer, winked in the middle of the negotiations. Like, well, you knew this person very well. So how about that? Yeah, the bad practices thing. That is one of my pitfalls. That was a very helpful part about the book. The scenario you just described would have driven me crazy. It would have disrupted me. It would have messed with me. And it's funny because you can talk garbage like Lee does in hockey. When you play sports with me, I'm fine. That doesn't get under my skin. I see what you're doing. It's cool. I see through it. It's fine. Maybe I'll give it back just a little bit cleaner. But in negotiation, when I see people do these transparently, not ethical, bad practice routines, all of which were laid out beautifully toward the end of the book, it drives me crazy. I feel like that is a breach of trust. You are not a trustworthy person. I go, I wouldn't say hot anger, but in that moment, I have this sense of, okay, I learned what I needed to learn about you right there. And I need to calculate what my next move is. Because I guess this is how we're doing things. And I loved that in the book, they talked about bad practices and how to meet them in a way that was very humbling for me because I've spent all this time around this document that I think has a deity behind it. And I've taught from it even. And this document would be in keeping with the teachings of how to get to yes in terms of how to respond to bad behavior. You don't meet it with more bad behavior. There's the principle of love, your enemy, turn the other cheek, you know, patience, the long view. All of that is very biblical and it's also very get to yes-ish. But for me, sometimes when people do that stuff, I feel the temptation, though, I don't think I act on that temptation too much. But I feel like, all right, well, I just need to show you what that behavior looks like by doing that behavior to you. And it's cathartic to think about it. I can't usually bring myself to do it, but it's the wrong attitude. The attitude they described in the book is the right attitude. You don't meet the bad behavior with more of the bad behavior and hope that the manipulator will see what manipulation looks like and not like it and then have this heart changing Lando Calrissian moment where all of a sudden they don't want to do bad things anymore. I'm so sorry for how I negotiated. It's not going to happen. Instead, the advice is something that I've seen work really well in other settings, and that is just to say exactly what's happening. Well, we agreed to this formally yesterday. We agreed to it formally in the first 15 minutes of this meeting. And now you've just changed the agreement. So if that is how we're to negotiate, then am I safe to assume that I'm allowed to make changes now as well, that favor me at the last minute and exert pressure against you now that we have a deadline to try to get the things I want. Like that technique of we're having a negotiation, you have chosen to employ something that we had precluded based on ethics and dignity, but now you're introducing it. So in the name of equity, I assume it would be okay for me to do that to you as well. But what's their answer going to be? Yeah, you can be manipulative and horrible and dishonest too. I mean, they're not going to say that. They're not going to say that. What I have found and I didn't connect the dots until right here, what I found in counseling and crisis management and all these other things that have been on the giving and receiving end of is when you get that really manipulative person or the person who maybe isn't manipulative, but right now they're being manipulative, the best thing you can do to checkmate that is say exactly what they're doing in front of everyone. Right now you're choosing to do this. The rest of the parties are choosing to do this. The way you're coming at it puts everyone else in this position. Is that the precedent you'd like to set for the remainder of our conversation? And it wins every time it makes people very angry. I mean, when when the manipulator has their manipulation called out, the gig is up and they they will turn on you. But it had not occurred to me that by simply announcing calmly what is being done takes away the power of the thing. And I love the point that they made about. Usually you won't even have to do anything more than just point it out. That's it. You don't have to defeat it. The diagnosis is the cure. It's interesting, isn't it? It is. I thought it was very, very good. When they said, Hey, it seems like, you know, when you're talking about the handling, the good cop, bad cop routine, it sounds like you, you know, the YouTube people have some differences, which you like to call a recess. So you could work it out. Love that. I thought that was clever. Yeah. Oh, it's so good. I see what you're doing and I will meet it with straightforwardness. I thought this was a great book and I appreciate your willingness to listen to it. It was really fun. So, um, yeah, I look forward to what book we have coming up next. Do you have any ideas for that? Uh, no, but I'll think about it and I will get back to you promptly. We'll have an announcement in the next episode or two. Yeah. And I look forward to employing all these things in my negotiations, moving forward. The problem is if you know all the techniques, I'm not going to be able to negotiate against you as effectively anymore. So maybe it was foolish to let you listen to this book. Okay. One, I like what you're doing there because it's funny to in praise to the book and to you for how you come at negotiating this book, whether the third chair sitting with us right now is listen to it or not. This book, I'm telling you. It doesn't propose manipulation. It is not suggesting how to weasel your way to getting the things that you want. It's not Machiavellian. This book proposes a very transparent mutual interest, workshop the problem, workshop the situation together above board, slow and patient. If need be empathetic approach, there's a sustainable ethic of human interaction present in this book that I find to be very compatible with deeply held religious beliefs that I have. And so I expected to go in and find a hot shot car salesman. Here's how to get the things you want out of other people without them knowing what just happened to them. But that's not what this book is about at all. Hey, you could hand this book to somebody you're about to enter into negotiations with and say, here's my entire playbook. Read this. If it makes sense to you, maybe we could draw on this as we try to figure out what makes sense for both of us. It's that transparent. Okay. All that's great. But ever since you said the word Machiavellian, Machiavellian, I didn't hear anything else. Because I don't know what that word means. And I need you to tell me. Machiavelli, Nicola Machiavelli. He is the, um, the Florentine late Renaissance author who wrote the prints and it's a short book of advisements toward a Florentine prints from Florence, Italy. About that's great. And I wonder for what is the word to get the things you want. So Machiavellian means things philosophically drawn from Machiavellis, the print. So it's a power play book. It is the aggressive power broker, car salesman, defeat people with politics and intrigue approach. And I think this is the opposite of that. Yeah. Awesome. Sweet. Learn a new word. Read a cool book. I hope you enjoyed the note of questions podcast. This is a lot of fun, man. Great, great recommendation. And thank you for entertaining my pushback on how far reaching the scope of it really is. I'm fine with us agreeing to disagree on that point. Oh, yeah. I'm completely cool with you being wrong in front of a lot of people. I'm fine with that. I'm good with that too. Weird. It's a good bad. OK. No, and all seriousness, this is great. Thanks, man. I really appreciate you. Likewise, buddy. Appreciate the conversation. Yep.
