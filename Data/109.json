Why is that? Today is the first game of the Rocket City trash pandas in their stadium. Oh, yeah. I know. That's crazy because I've been wearing Rocket City trash panda merch for like two years because it looks rad, but they've never actually done any baseballing. Yeah, well, well, I guess technically I'm not being a hundred percent truthful. They did play in Chattanooga. This is the first home game and I'm taking the kids. I'm excited. You're a season ticket holder. Yeah, absolutely. We, uh, we got in super, super early. And the idea was that, you know, we've got a bunch of kids that go to school with our kids and like we could use that as like a community season ticket kind of deal. That was the idea. For members of the third chair who are not from North America or a baseball country, where did the Rocket City trash pandas rank in the whole hierarchy of baseball? Okay. So you've got the major league, which is MLB baseball, Major League baseball. And so that's where like you're, I mean, the Braves, which is obviously the best baseball team clearly. I mean, they're, they're good. They're not like lame, like a team, like the Colorado Rockies or anything like that. You know, I'm not going to argue. I know what you're trying to do, but it's not going to work because I root for the worst franchise and professional sports. And I know it. So it's going to go with you. I admire that. You're not a summer soldier or a sunshine patriot. You are the real deal. So I mean, yeah, that's awesome. So the big teams, the, you know, the A's, the angels, the giants, the whoever, that's Major League Baseball. So there's also this league below that. Some people call them a farm team, uh, minor league baseball. You'll hear it called a bunch of different things, but the Rocket City trash pandas are a farm league, farm team for the Anaheim Angels. It's kind of like you want these guys to get ready to play Major League, but they're not right. You know, they're not really there yet, but you want to develop them and all that kind of stuff. How old are these players? I don't know, man. When the Huntsville stars, which was the original team in Huntsville, when they used to play, we had like no joke. There was one time where Mark Maguire, Jose Consenko, and I forget the other guy's name, they were all playing here in Huntsville. Because the Huntsville stars was a farm team. What do you call it? How do you say it? Yeah. Yeah. Farm team, that's great. The minor league franchise for, or however you want to say it. So they were a farm team for the Oakland Athletics back in the day. So Maguire, Consenko, that was cool, man. It won't wice on that team. Terry Steinbach playing in. Yeah. Terry Steinbach. He was a catcher here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He was a Fluke All-Star game MVP in like 1989 or something. But those A's teams were great and they all came through town for you. That's kind of the fun of Major League or minor league baseball. Yeah. You get to see people that are going to be incredible later on. The longest home run in the history of professional baseball happened at Mile High Stadium. Yes, it did. The Denver Zephyrs. They were the Denver Bears for a while and the Denver Zephyrs for a while. Greg Vaughn was in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league system and he hit a ball practically out of Mile High Stadium. You can see a hundred thousand people practically in that state. I was a huge, huge football field that was not meant for baseball. And I'd gone to a bunch of those minor league games with my little league coach. And then we saw that highlight of where Greg Vaughn hit that ball and all of us. Joey Meyer was his name. Oh, it was Joey Meyer. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. No, I saw Greg Vaughn play there. Yeah, Joey Meyer. Big, burly first baseman with a mustache, right? I don't know. I just googled it. I just googled it. I remember that that's where it was hit because when I was doing the research for the world's longest home run video, which was the big bat that we made that swung around and around and then hit the baseball at 700 some feet, we had to figure out what the longest one in history was. And it was right there in Denver. 700 feet. It's like a golf ball exploding off of a driver. Baseballs are not physically meant to go that far. It's just obscene that you got to see that with your own eyes. And I saw the video and that's nice and all. You saw that with your own eyes. I've seen a 500 foot home run at Quars Field in Colorado and it just, it doesn't look like the physics of the planet should allow for that. It is so baffling to see it pop off the bat that way. 700 feet. Well, you cheated. You engineered. Yeah, we cheated. We did engineering, but did you actually go to those games growing up? Like did you go to the Zephyrs or whatever it was? Yeah. Yeah. There was no pro baseball in Colorado, no major league baseball back then. I was a senior in high school, I believe, when the Rockies started playing ball. And it was a huge deal. They were going to build a stadium downtown, but they had to play in the Denver Broncos football field for the longest time. I went to maybe like the fourth game in the history of the franchise. I watched the first at bat in the history of the franchise. They had like 80,000 people there for a baseball game. That never happens. No, 80,000 people in baseball, starved Colorado and Eric Young, a little guy, a little speedster lead off hitter hit a home run in his first at bat in the first at bat in the history of the Rockies. No way. And the place just it melted down like the Broncos were going to the Super Bowl or something. It was a legendary moment. They're like, we're going to be the best team ever. I mean, probably there's no way in 2021 people will look back on this franchise and say, how have they never even won a division title? Because we're going to be great. We're on track to hit a home run in every at bat for the entire history of the franchise. Yeah, that's amazing. It's been disappointing. Did you see what happened with my team this off season? No, what happened? So the Colorado Rockies have had arguably the three best infielders in the last 20 years of baseball come up through their farm system so people could go and watch them play like you're going to be able to down the street with the trash pandas. DJ LeMayhew, who's been an American League MVP with the Yankees after the Rockies let him walk for nothing. Trevor Story, who's maybe the best shortstop in the game, who they're about to let walk away for absolutely nothing. And then Nolan Aronado, who might go down in history is the best third baseman ever. Better than Ozzy Smith. No, he's a second baseman. Oh, Ozzy Smith is a shortstop. Oh, was he who my? Trevor Story is he's a better shortstop than Ozzy Smith. Wade Boggs is what I'm thinking about. Uh, I think Nolan's a better third baseman than Wade Boggs. Wow. I think Nolan is going to go down as a better third baseman than George Brett, Mike Schmidt, Brooks Robinson. He's the man. It's phenomenal what he can do over there, both sides of the ball. He's a phenomenal defender, incredible offensive numbers. He got into some kind of TIFF with our general manager who went to Harvard and knows a lot of things because of how he went to Harvard, Moneyball and, uh, well, the opposite of Moneyball. Like whatever dumb baseball is, that's what the Rockies did. And so they couldn't, they couldn't work it out. They just couldn't work out their relationship. And so they traded Nolan Aronado to the Cardinals for the Cardinals, like 13th best minor league prospect and the Rockies pay $50 million of Nolan Aronado's salary, not to play for them anymore. What? We made that deal. Mm hmm. Yeah. The team I root for thought that was a good idea. Did you say 50 million, like five zero? Yeah, like 50 five zero million dollars pinky to the side of my lip. That's how much money we're paying the St. Louis Cardinals to take the best player in the history of baseball at a given position. So he won't play for us anymore. There's something we don't know. Pictures, maybe he's got pictures of somebody. He's got something. I like that's the one that's for my brain goes when things don't make sense. Got to be pictures. That's crazy. Yeah. So yeah, but minor league ball was something we did all the time as kids. My coach, Jay Aldinger, who is my favorite coach ever at any level of baseball, all the way up through college, post college, favorite coach ever was Jay of the Fort Collins Junior Minor League Cardinals. He's a warm, kind, wonderful man. He came to my graduation years and years later and he would put us all in this wood-sided station wagon that he had left over from the 70s and he would drive the team down and we'd taken a game down and watching the minor leagueers play. And we'd talk about what we learned on the drive back and we never got much better at baseball, but I loved it. That was my first phone call was to my son's baseball coach. I said, Hey, we have season tickets and I would like to give you whatever day you want. First phone call. And so yeah, it's it's a big deal to go as a team like as a little league baseball team to go with some people to a trash panda's game. That was huge. That's huge, right? Yeah. And I mean, this is just right down the street for, I mean, what an event to, and okay, maybe you can speak to this. What's the difference in your experience in the atmosphere at a major league game versus the atmosphere at a minor league game? A major league game is almost overproduced. Like everybody has their special walk up music. It just feels it feels like you're at some kind of business event. Whereas a minor league game, people will just get it. They're like, yeah, it doesn't really matter if my team wins or loses. It's all about developing these players and getting them to the next level. We're just kind of all bought into this idea that that the score actually matters, but we all know it really doesn't. That's a good take. You know, at the major league game, you get really upset if your team loses like good grief, man. This guy's striking out. What did they pull him? You know, I mean, the stress level is so much higher, but in a minor league game, you don't care, dude. You're just like, whatever. Maybe they do good. Maybe they don't. I don't care. They'll be fireworks at the end. This sounds great. Yeah. Have you ever been there for one of their goofy theme nights that they do at minor league games? Absolutely. Yeah. What have you seen? Well, you know, they used to do things like Star Wars night and all kinds of silly things. You see that kind of stuff, but I've never I've never been. So I guess I said the wrong thing there. No, I haven't been on one of those goofy nights that I can remember. I remember going to the basketball games that had stuff like that. But why wouldn't you see? Oh, I don't know. A bunch of stupid stuff. Just gimmicky nights and minor league hockey. You get to do the chunk of puck thing where you take a foam puck and you get to throw it out on the ice and try to land it in a circle and score points. They try to make it more interactive and they try to make the PA announcing more fun and all of that. Because you don't know the players. You're not that invested in the players. It's the atmosphere, the experience and just seeing some higher quality baseball than you can get at the local little league field. That's the fun of it. Get some food and beer. It's just a nice outing and minor league ball is cheap. So they do ridiculous gimmicky stuff and all these different minor league teams try to out gimmick each other with like really goofy outside the box ideas that you could just never do at the dignified professional level. I've got one. I've got one I heard about recently that is really OK, the Savannah bananas. That's a team. They used to be the Savannah sand nats when I was growing up, but still do it. Yeah, the Savannah bananas. They play this thing called banana ball. Have you heard of this? No, no, keep going. This is this is why I tune in. Go ahead. They change the rules of baseball to be the following. Every inning counts, meaning you get like a point for the inning. OK, there's a two hour time limit. There's no stepping out. There's no bunting. And I think they say there's no bunting because bunting is lame or something like that. OK, there's can steal first. No walks allowed one on one showdown tiebreaker. And no mound visits. And if a fan catches a foul ball, it's an out. And so what? Yeah, I'm not cool. You can record an out as a spectator. Yes. This is a genius. Isn't it also? I love it. But like the one on one showdown is if there's a tie at the end of the game, they're like, no, we're not going to end the game. And a tie they'll have a pitcher versus a batter. The batter hits the ball and if the the guy can run all the way around the basis by the time the guy gets back to the home plate or something like that, then it's an out or something like that. I don't know. It sounds really, really cool. So I would love to see that, but they're actually taking the Savannah banana banana ball game on the road. Sounds really fun. Oh, that's brilliant. The idea that your fans somehow contribute to your success beyond just cheering. Wow. What a fascinating idea. And you can get away with it because there are no stakes. If your fans don't catch the ball as well as the other team's fans and you lose it banana ball. So who cares? But did you see that fat guy try to catch that ball? I drop his notchos on his girlfriend. Because that's the point. I know. So let me read one of these. OK, one on one showdown tiebreaker. This is the official Savannah bananas rules here. It says each team picks one pitcher and one hitter to face off. The defensive team only has the pitcher and catcher on the field. All the other fielders are off the field. If a hitter puts the bomb play, he has to score and make it home to get a point. If the ball is put in play, the pitchers allowed to chase the ball and throw the ball to the catcher for a play at the plate. And if a pitcher strikes him out or gets him out before scoring, they don't get the point. So it's kind of complicated, but it's really, really cool. First team to reach five points wins. It sounds awesome. I love it. So these PA announcers at the minor league games, they're not like the ones at the major league games, which are also serious and somber. They get to screw around and razz the crowd and make it fun and goofy and try out their material. And so I got asked to do the PA system at my 10 year old boys little league game last night. No, you did not said yes. I did. Let me get this straight. You have a captive audience of of parents and children. Yes, I do. And you have a microphone and you get to broadcast anything you want to all of these people and they have to listen to it. Anything I want. This is like they leave their child. All right. So we got to go. What did you do? Like, well, first of all, I've noticed at Little League games these days, there's this trend that I hate. That is like little Johnny's coming up to bat. Let's play his quote, walk up music. Uh huh. I hate that. Have you seen this yet? Yeah, I've seen it and I don't do it. OK, because I hate that you're not good. I'm glad. OK, I just want to criticize that before you go. So you don't do that. Hmm. No walk up music, tough luck. You're going to walk up there in the awkward silence of the crowd being distracted by their phones and other things that are going on. OK, because they know that what's going to happen is you're going to walk up there and you're this is an 80% chance that you're going to walk on five pitches. And then you're going to go down to first base and then the next batter is going to have three or four pass balls occur during his at bat, which will move you to second. And then to third and then we get to the actual fate of your at bat, which is the ball goes to the backstop while you're at third base. You run home. The catcher runs and grabs the ball. And if he can win the race back to home plate, you're out. And if you can't, you scored a run. That that's where the entire. That's 10 year old baseball right there. That's the whole game right there. That's it. So you got to do something to spice that up a little bit and make it more fun. So my kids coach comes up and he's like, Oh, so you're announcing him. I was like, yeah, hey, how much am I allowed to do here? What are you, what are you looking for? He's like, man, I don't care. Whatever you want. And I said, whatever I want. And he's like, I just, yeah. Yep. Whatever. OK. So it's like you can only talk like when they're walking from the dugout to the batter box, right? That's it. Well, what I discovered is no. I can actually talk a little bit while play is unfolding and nobody gets mad. No, you can't do that in real life because it messes with the players, but nobody got mad. So I just kept inching more and more into play by play. And I haven't gone over to the top with it yet. I got into the play and called some things as they were unfolding. I may have slightly affected the outcome of the game as a result of that. I got to be careful not to cross the line. Are you like, it's a hot ground or a shortstop? Are you saying things like that? I sure did. No, you did not sharply hit line drive to the right side. That drops for a base hit. Will rounds first and thinks better of it. He'll remain there now batting number five, Kyle. Kyle. Yeah, I get to do stuff like that. It's really, really fun. Uh huh. Yeah. And then weird things happen because it's kids baseball. And so the field is kind of awkward and sloped weird and a kid hit a foul ball dribbler down the third baseline. So the umpire, it's all volunteer and it's all parents doing all this stuff. He stands up, waves his hands above his head and yells foul ball. Well, when you call foul ball, the play is dead. There's no coming back from it. The play is dead. Well, you got to wait to call foul ball until you're really sure that ball is going to stay foul because if something screwy happens, the ball could squirt back into fair territory before it passes third base, in which case, that's now a fair ball. Well, that's exactly what happened right after he called foul ball. So everybody knows you're not allowed to yell at the umpse. Like you will not a word. You will get run out of there in a second. You cannot criticize the umpse. What are you talking about? You can't criticize the umpse. They're all dads. Nobody's getting paid. It's all like somebody from the crowd. They just pull them in. OK, OK. And like there's this pledge you have to take beforehand. Like we all had to take the pledge and it's like, I will never criticize anyone for anything ever again. Forget that. Some other stuff like that. Yeah. And so this ball squirts back fair and the, you know, the coach from the team that lost out on it comes running down. He's like, hey, that's a fair ball. Kids safe at first. He's like, well, I called it foul. And I forgot I even had the mic on him. Like, hey, once a ball is called foul, that is a dead ball. It's like the P announcer cannot weigh in on it. They can tighten the umpse. The coach. So I will settle this with a voice from above. Did she really? Oh, yeah. And that drew a couple of looks after that. I did better though. I I calmed down. I got a little excited right here. You're like, I am the arbiter of truth. That's game. Did you did you? I did. Oh, it was bad form, but everybody's cool. Everyone is cool. The umpires seem to appreciate me having his back on that one. And so that was within the first half inning. Dude, that's a big deal. Yeah, you're not supposed to do that stuff. But, you know, I kept loosening up more and kind of figuring out what would fly and what wouldn't. And I'm cracking jokes and making fun of myself and a bunch of other things. And then I decided that I was going to play music in between innings. And so I did this, like whole announcer voice routine. And I was doing an announcer voice the whole time, Mike. I'm not going to get up there on the mic and sound like me. Give me a little bit. Give me a little bit of an announcer voice. Now batting the second baseman number six. Patrick things like that. Yeah. So, you know, you got to give it a little bit of energy. You know, you're going to work that mic a little bit. Well, then after the first half inning, you know, for those in the third chair, who aren't familiar with baseball, the team's trade sides, the team that was batting, trying to hit the ball, goes out in the field to defend. And then they change it up. And they're usually there's music in between. And so I made an announcement to a really relatively full house. Attention fans and players to keep the energy up and to keep our young men excited to play. Every half inning changeover will feature the greatest pump up stadium, anthem artist of all time, Michael Bolton. And then I proceeded to play Kenny G and Michael Bolton music over the entire game. Oh, man. And you're going to send you this right now. Careless whisper would have been a good choice. Why don't you win? Why don't you? If I would have played like some careless whisper or something like that. Oh, I'll go wam next time. You should. Yeah. Great. That's important. I don't want these to be good. Good heavens. You're I'm sending you over the lineup sheet right now. And if you look down in the lower right hand corner, you'll see my list of Michael Bolton songs that I'd already played so that I wouldn't accidentally repeat a Michael Bolton song. Yeah, I wanted to keep it fresh. And when I put on love is a wonderful thing in the middle of the third inning there. I did catch one of the coaches dancing. Nice. So it worked. Yeah. Missing you now is what I led with, which has some wicked sacks said I loved you, but I lied. Love is a wonderful thing. When a man loves a woman, the Percy Sledge cover, steel bars of the distance from Disney's Hercules, time, love and tenderness. And then when the kids shook hands at the end, I played his duet that he did with Dolly Parton on, I will always love you. I think it was a great night for everybody. And I forget there's a microphone. I just forgot the microphone existed. Kind of like you did at the baseball game. That's not good. Dude, that's the most fun I've had in a long time. And I think I can abuse my privileges even further. I will give you updates as it unfolds. I'm going to find what the limits are. And then I'm going to walk it back about one degree from there and keep it right there. Dang, that's good. That's awesome, man. Well, congratulations. Thank you. So your favorite player of all time. I know this about you, George Brett. Yes, that's correct. You know mine. Check this out. I've got a, uh, got a card right here. Oh, you got it. I've done the thing. Yeah, that's Cal Ripken Jr. See that's great. Yeah. What year is that? This is a, I'm looking 1982. Thus making it his rookie card. It says, is it really? Yeah, that's why I got it for you. Well, it says 81. It says he played an 81. Yeah, but not enough games to qualify. So if you're a late season call up, they do a roster expansion in the major leagues at the end of the year. So they'll empty out the minor leagues and bring players up and give them, you know, get them past the shock and awe moment. Yeah, and this is especially beneficial for teams that are going nowhere and just need to get some at bats and a little experience. So that does not count as your rookie campaign. You have to cross a certain threshold of games played in order to have that be your rookie campaign. And most of the time, the, well, at least back in the day, the card manufacturers would not make cards for September call ups. Really? It's expanded minor league play for all intents and purposes. And so the rookie card is the first card after the first year the player actually qualifies. And this was before they said rookie on the card. Well, some of them did. Donras as a manufacturer did like a rated rookie series for a while. If they thought they were going to be good and tops did that later in the 80s. But yeah, back in the day, it was just like, that's just the rookie card. And for whatever reason, a rookie card is the most valuable card of a player, you know, unless there's some fluke error card that was only printed a few hundred times, the rookie card is always the really valuable one. Well, thank you for that. I didn't realize it was his rookie card. I didn't have this one. It says it's got his minor league stats on the back. He played for Bluefield, which I've never heard of Miami. This was long before in the Marlins. Charlotte Rochester and the Orioles. And he didn't actually have good stats. Cal Ripken Jr. We're looking at a batting average of 128, which was not good. September call up, you know, the best look. He made it. Wait, how many games did he play in his official rookie year though? Right here, it says 22. OK, so that I don't know if that was the beginning of his all time consecutive games streak or if that started the next year or what? That's a good point. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. That's the little curious. The lowest it's ever. Oh, he was six four. I didn't know that. God, he put your your height right there on the card. That'd be weird. All right. For that. There's no, I mean, how's that even relevant? Yeah, no, exactly. So let's just create a hierarchy based on height. Is that really where we need to be right now as a society? I agree. Yeah, I'd like to see that stricken. So you know what this this card reminds me of is the time I was in Vegas and I met with our mutual friend, Rocky, who I did not know at that time. And he decided he was going to just do like, Hey, how's it going? Nice to meet you. Here's a gift for you. And I opened. He's like, Hey, I got you something. He's like, don't open it now. Open it later. I was like, OK, cool. Thanks. And then I I on my way home, I opened this little box and it's filled with wood shavings and a pack of ketchup. And I was like, what? And then and then I and then I dug through the wood shavings and there was a George Brett. I think I don't know that it was a rookie card, but it was a George Brett card. And I realized that Rocky thought George Brett was my favorite player, but he was like, or Cal Ripken Jr was my favorite player. Did he give you a Cal Ripken Jr card? No, but I think he had intended to. And I think somewhere. Maybe we talked about it on the podcast and he got it straight later or something. Yeah. But yeah, I think he meant to give you. I think he thought George Brett was your favorite player. Oh, but Rocky's there with you, right? Is he like, he helps you stuff now, right? Yep. He lives in this neck of the woods now and we hang out and play tennis and work on projects. And he still occasionally travels to do his work gig. Have we talked about what he does for a living? No, I just know he's a very handsome man. That's all I know. That is one of his superpowers. He's a very handsome man. He's buying stuff on Facebook right now because he's bought a house. So he's doing the Facebook marketplace. He just bought six saws for $6 the other day. What? So now he has six saws. They were a dollar each, but you have to buy them all. OK, I would do that. So he showed up the other day because, you know, it's Facebook marketplace. Who knows what you're going to get? He showed up the other day and some lady answered the door as he described it. And he did so very modestly. Like he didn't understand why the lady said this, but I did. He's like, yeah, I went and I knocked on the door and this lady answered. And she was like, whoa, you are not what I was expecting. I'm like, well, it's because you're good looking. No, I don't think so. I think she saw a different profile picture. No, no, it's just because you're good looking. That's it, buddy. You live in the bubble, the bubble of attractiveness that I don't understand. You didn't know it was good looking. That's pretty entertaining. It's pretty good. No, I mean, this is this is the rocky for the third chair's sake, who it was wedding you just attended that we talked about last time around. And he and his wife, Avi met doing what he does for a living, which is corporate spokespersoning. He goes to those big events in Las Vegas. That's why he lived in Las Vegas for so long. But he's there, right? Well, yeah, yeah, he's, uh, he's working in the other room. You got another mic? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we set up for this just in case anybody was ever here you want to talk to you want to talk to Rocky? Yeah, just bring him on. Okay. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Yeah, this will be fun. Hey, this episode of No Dumb Questions is brought to you by Hello Fresh. And with Hello Fresh, you get fresh pre-measured ingredients and mouthwatering seasonal recipes delivered right to your door.

And that's why it's America's number one meal kit. That's a really good paragraph they gave us. And it's very reflective of my experience with Hello Fresh. My son and I actually made Hello Fresh last night. What'd you make? We made creamy dill chicken, like D-I-L-L, like the herb. And it was amazing because I was doing two things. I was learning how to make chicken and I was also learning how many dad jokes you can use with the word dill. Oh, so many. Oh, yeah. My son, this is a, uh, this sauce is a really big deal. You should try this, you know, and it's like, it's just so many. It was amazing. Yeah, exactly. But eventually I wore him down and he started making jokes with me, speaking of which we have a dill for everyone with Hello Fresh here. You monster. But what's our promo code this time? Uh, it's NDQ 12, right? I'm like 99% sure. And now I am 100% sure the promo code is NDQ 12 and you're going to get, uh, 12 free meals, including free shipping, which is awesome. Yeah, you should totally do this. So the way Hello Fresh works is they mail recipes and ingredients, the right amount of the ingredients directly to your house and all you have to do is follow the recipe and you can cook an amazing meal and you will be super happy because what I find so interesting about Hello Fresh is the sauces, the fact that you can make a sauce on your own and it tastes like something you legitimately would get at a restaurant. That's incredible to me because I, when I open the pantry and I see all the things, I can't imagine making something from scratch that has an incredible amount of saucy tastes, you know? Yes, but you can do it with Hello Fresh. That's the deal. We did a steak with sauce the other night. I can't remember which one it is. This is, I've been ordering it. All the steak with sauce meals I can get. And my wife had just finished skilting up the little slices of steak and the sauce was just starting to become the correct viscosity. And I saw her sneak a little bite, run it through that sauce in the hot pan and she made this face like dang, that was good. And I was like, Hey, deal me in. She gave me one deal. You and I have no idea what you're talking about. No, it's, it's super, super good. Um, we went out of town when we went to see you guys in South Dakota. And instead of pausing your order, which you can totally do, we gave it to the neighbors and they said, Hey, you need to go out of town more often because that was the first time we had Hello Fresh and it was incredible. So if you have Hello Fresh, have you ever considered giving the Hello Fresh meal that you get at your house? Like you can take it because it's all on a bag, giving it to like a family member or something like that? Yes, Matt. I see your hand raise. I have, I've thought of that because we went out of town a while back and forgot to pause it and then we were like, Oh man, we're not going to be back in time. But we were getting our mail at this UPS store. So I called the UPS lady who's super nice. I was like, Hey, we're not going to be back in time to eat that Hello Fresh, but it's really good. You should try it if you ever had it and she was like, no, so we gave it to her. And then I hadn't been back over there in forever. And I went by just last week. And the first thing she wanted to talk with me about upon seeing me for the first time in months and months and months was exactly that. Really? Yes, it has occurred to me. And Hello Fresh made the people at the UPS store have a happier life. Yeah, it is a way to win friends and influence people. But if you want to be a hashtag food influencer, get Hello Fresh.

We'd be grateful when you support the sponsors that supports Notre Dame questions and we appreciate it. OK, Rocky joins us. Well, hey, they're rocky. How's it going? I'm pretty good. How are you doing? Well, doing well. So we were talking about just you and Vegas in general. But you remember the time you brought me a baseball card in Vegas? You remember that? Yes. Yes, I do. Do you do you remember who my favorite player is? Oh, no, quarterly. Do you remember who Matt's favorite player is? Well, Brett Butler. No, Cal Ripken Jr. See, I still I'm getting it. No, it's thank you. You gave me George Brett. George Brett. There you go. That's where it was. Yeah. You know, say it again. You get it. You happy? No, leave that. Yeah. I'm letting him off the hook. Yeah, it proves that proves that what happened happened. Now we can tell. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So dude, first of all, thank you. Cal Ripken Jr is my favorite player. And you thought to bring me a George Brett card and I'm grateful because you realize that George Brett was Matt's favorite, which somehow got. What made you think to do that? Like people don't usually give a gift the first time they meet somebody. Um, well, two things. Obviously, we are of a similar generation. So baseball cards kind of fit with our generation and I have a ton of them, especially 1987 baseball cards. If it exists, I have a copy. Really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Top's baseball cards in 1987 got at least one of every card, probably, except for the most expensive ones I imagine. And, uh, and so I'm listening to one of you guys episodes and you both mentioned your favorite baseball player. And, uh, I immediately think, Oh, I, I can visualize those cards. I have them. Sadly, I didn't spend any time remembering which one you both wanted, or you appreciated, but, uh, when I knew you were coming in town, the first thing I thought was this is a perfect opportunity to break the ice and say, yeah, here is Matt's favorite baseball card. You would want that. Do you remember what else you put in the box? Uh, I think, uh, empty mayonnaise maybe. It was a packet. Maybe it was mayonnaise. I think it was a packet of mayonnaise. No, I think it, I think it was a packet of a catch up. Uh, it could have been catch up. What was the thought there? Uh, once again, I think it just struck me as funny, something you probably had mentioned at some point. And maybe it was catch up. And I thought mayonnaise is probably funnier. Let me start with that. That's pretty good. Okay. So Rocky, you lived in Vegas. Cause I remember, I don't even remember why I was in town. I think it was doing a talky talk or something. I don't remember, but I remember you picked me up at a hotel and we went ate a burrito or a burger or whatever it was. We talked about all kinds of stuff, but I remember thinking this would be the weirdest place in the world to live. Oh gosh. You couldn't be more correct. Well, I mean, Vegas is not only the strangest place to live, but even the, the way that I found myself in Vegas was incredibly strange. So I leave the Marine Corps in 2004 and I have no idea what I'm going to do. And I take an opportunity in LA and while I'm there, I meet a guy and he says that he's in LA for a short period of time, but he's from Vegas. And he's 25, same as me. And he says, well, um, if you don't like LA and you'd like to move to Vegas, I own three houses and I'm studying to be a fireman. But I make really good money bartending on the strip. When? So if you, yeah, 25 years old, he owns three houses. Now if you remember this time, it's 2004, 2005, we know how the story ends. Yeah. But it's not 2008 yet. So at this point, he owns three houses, 25 years old. And we're not talking about starter houses. Like he owns four bedroom houses, one of which has a pool. And so he offers me to live for free in one of his homes until I get on my feet. So I jump on the opportunity. I go to Vegas and I get a job as a bar back in a nightclub. As a what? A bar back. So you have bar back spell that bar back. So exactly like you think B.A.R B.A.C.K. Okay. And so a bar back's job in essence, and these, these fast pace bars, they're moving so fast that they don't have time to restock. So you have someone that supports you, a bar back that is literally just running to the back of the house, grabbing more beer, grabbing more liquor, and then restocking all of the shelves. So the bartender never loses a beat, always is fully stocked or close to it and can serve more cocktails. So the ironic thing is a bar back is the lowest position. You can find yourself in one of these nightclubs and he tells me, if you start, you're only going to make $300 a night. But with time, you'll probably average about $500, $600 a night. What? That's that's that's. Yes. Oh, oh, what? That's good money, man. What? Yeah. And that's not that's not 2020's money. That's 2004 money. Oh, hold on. Dang. I'm pulling the calculator out. Hold on. 300. How many days a week would you work? So so here's the thing. You're only working usually three nights a week because you're working three nights a week, and then you're required to go out, which is another part of this whole story that expands on how crazy this is. So you go out three nights a week, you make $600. You're making $1,800 a week. But on your off nights, you are going to go to a sister property somewhere at the casino. They've got another bar and this is where it opens up the world to atmospheric, atmosphere modeling means that people like myself, people from Georgia are going to go to Vegas. And they're going to, they're going to be charged $3,000 to have a place to sit in one of these bars and one of these nightclubs. But no one's going to spend throughout $3,000. Time out, time out, time out, time out. So you're saying because you're a smoking hot dude, you're saying that someone will pay you money to sit in a room and look hot and be attractive. That's it. So let's see. Be attractive. It's a yes or no question, Rocky. Well, I have to push back. It's not that they're paying me. I, in essence, have gotten paid $1,800 for working at the property next door. I, as a requirement of that glorious position, now spend my night off or one or two of my nights off per week going to another property and drinking free alcohol. So as to make the club look full in a way that people from George on a bachelor party are going to spend $3,000 on three bottles of vodka and some orange juice. Now, the yes part of your question is, is there are girls that don't bartend. They don't bar back that are atmosphere models that get paid $250 a night and they show up at 11 o'clock at night and they leave at 2 a.m. So if you go to a club in Vegas at 2 a.m. If you see just all of the guests seem to be filtering out, you know exactly who was paid to be there. So girls that are attractive enough are definitely getting paid to be in that club and to make it, you know, look good for the schmucks like us that are going to go in there and pay. Well, not me. I'm not paying for it, but there are people that are paying an arm and a leg to sit down in a club. So you're creating the illusion of demand, the illusion of scarcity, the illusion of exclusivity, the illusion of this club is only for the sexy people. And if you are in it, you might be worth paneling Alexa money. If you want to be in like the super sexy circle, like if you want to go down to like the cheeseburger place, like anybody can get in there. But this place is like for attractive people and there's a little bit of a buy in. Ah, yeah, that sounds really shallow and it sounds pretty darn accurate. You're good. Amazing. No, I wasn't good at so. So the reason why I know all this is I end up going to Vegas before Memorial Day. And for four months from Memorial Day to Labor Day, this hot season, I work and I'm a zombie going to work at 10 o'clock at night, getting off at six in the morning, going to talk about before I crash on the couch. So I do this for four months and then it slows down and the numbers probably decrease by a third. But you still got bartenders that are making 60, $70,000 a year. Two thousand four money. Yes. And you've got cocktail waitresses. This is the craziest thing. The cocktail waitresses are the real money makers. So they are not only selling $700 bottles of gray goose and you have to buy two, of course, in order to take care of the four guys that have come from Oklahoma for this party. So the cocktail waitresses are selling a minimum of two bottles of vodka at $700 a piece, but they order gratuity at 20%. And those atmosphere models are going to work in step with the cocktail waitresses to make sure that they drink as much free alcohol as they can so that that next bottle of vodka is purchased. And the next one. So by the time they leave at 2 a.m., the guys or girls presumably are hammered and they've spent $3,000, $4,000 and everyone else is drinking for free because of it. This is twisted and jacked up, man. I had no idea this was a thing. So this is like behind the scenes at Vegas. Like what really is this everywhere in Vegas or just like certain places? This is well, it's everywhere on the strip. Yeah, if you're going to a strip casino, which is that's the ones that the celebrities are going to. That's where the celebrity DJs are going. Those are the big draws. And you'll also recognize the timing of these performers are going to come on after all the money has been made. So before the performance comes out, they're going to have some local DJ spinning, get the crowd amped up, get the line built up outside, get all the people inside that are paying these heavy prices. And then once these paid atmosphere models start to filter out, now they've got space for your average show to come in and buy a drink. Got to watch out for those average shows. Yes, you certainly do. That's amazing. Like who was the first person to figure this out, I wonder? Like they said, oh, man, this sounds like weird plot lines in Star Wars is what this sounds like. The cantina. This is the most bizarre thing ever. This sounds wrong and illegal. It should be wrong. And I want to say that it probably started in New York because a lot of the properties in Vegas, they start in New York and then they come to Vegas. I think there's always been a tie between Vegas and New York, but I know, tell there's one in Vegas, there's one in New York and in a lot of nightclubs, that's how they work. And if that wasn't bad enough, so you leave the nightclub at six in the morning, it shuts down. Now, 2004, we have what starts the after hours party and these nightclubs will open up at three or four in the morning. They are playing the same game, except for it's a lot easier for them because everyone's nice and toasted by the time they open and they don't want to go home yet. They will stay open until 10 or 11 in the morning and then they will hand you off to a party pool like rehab. You know, obviously rehab was the first and the greatest party pool venture in 2004 and then now every casino has recognized the value of it. And so they turn you over on this continuous cycle of partying and debauchery and... What's a party pool? Like a swimming pool? Well, it's a cesspool, better described. But yes, technically it's a pool. It's a hotel pool, but it's specifically designed to sell expensive cocktails. The same atmosphere as a nightclub just outside during the day. And so if you want to spend three, four thousand dollars for two or three bottles of vodka, you can sit down in a largely a restaurant size booth for your five closest friends and be catered to by a cocktail waitress. Why do you think that works? Because okay, most people who are doing that can probably barely afford it. I'm sure some people go and it's just not money. It doesn't matter to them. But I lived in Vegas. I spent a bunch of time on this trip. Then you know, there are subtle cues as to who's got unbelievable money and who's a relatively normal person. And a lot of the time, I would see relatively normal people living pretty large in Vegas, doing things that they just wouldn't do with their money if they were at home. What do you think the psychological trick is to get people to play along like that when they're in Vegas? Well, I mean, that's the marketing campaign of Vegas. I mean, it's changed now, but in the day it was what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And so you've got people that, you know, they would never do this in their normal circles. But it seems as if society allows for this and promotes it in this one place, at least US-based. And so you do. You see people come in and they spend way more money than they have. I mean, I just keep going down the wormhole. So please stop me if I get too far down it. But the worst part is, is let's say you have John and Brian and they come in and they have put their credit card limits and they've got this, you know, this booth and they've got the atmosphere models that are pretending to flirt with them and the cocktail waitress that's upselling them. So they have enough liquor to give these girls. Well, that's great. But we also have to remember that Leonardo DiCaprio is coming in at 145. And the moment he comes in, not only the atmosphere girls, but every girl in the club is going to have drank your alcohol and then they're going to filter two booths over to hang out with George Clooney or whoever the celebrity is that night. And it's Vegas. So there's always one. You run into fancy people all the time when you were working there? I mean, it's one of those things that I tell these stories and everyone's like, Oh, you're, you're dropping names. That's, that's what you're doing. This is something for you. But really, I can't help it because it's just so intriguing to be a fly on the wall, just to be a normal guy. And then all of a sudden you're flirting with a girl and you think, okay, well, this is going pretty well. She seems nice. She's from Oklahoma, a normal girl in Vegas. This could work. And then you turn around and she's gone. Why? Well, because I am zeroing just walked in and I don't care how good your story is. Your smile is not that great. I am zeroing just walked in. And so if that's happening to me, is I'm just trying to live in Vegas at 25, mind you, it wasn't married at the time. It's that much sadder when you've got a group of guys that have come in for the weekend. They've lowered all of their inhibitions and now they're going to go home, brokenhearted and just manipulated. Forgive me. Who was the person that you said walked in the room? I didn't know that I didn't recognize the name. So his name's I am zeroing and I brought his name up because that let literally happen to me. When I first moved to Vegas, I had left the military and a decent looking guy. So when I was in the military, I was all right at flirting with a girl and at least getting partial attention. Boy, did that change when I moved to Vegas. And I use this example because when I go to Vegas, I find an attractive girl who's visiting. I think this is the first girl I've dated since I left the military. This is going to be great. We're talking for 30 minutes and I am zeroing who is famous for anybody who watched the original Beverly Hills 90210 walks in and he played Steve. Oh, Steve. Steve. I don't know. I don't know anything. All right. Well, I just looked at my internet. He said he was in Sharknado. You might recognize him from that. You're someone in Sharknado. You made a Sharknado guy? More of a snake on a plane kind of guy. I should have led with that. No, I'm also showing my colors because I had four sisters. Maybe that's the reason why I know this soap opera, this night soap opera from the 90s. Yeah, for sure. That's definitely it. No, but these are these are people will show up and okay. So you're saying that there's this veneer of manipulation across the whole thing. Yes. And it's one of those things to where I hate to use the word manipulation because there's no victims. The reality is social engineering. Social engineering. Social engineering for sure. For sure. And there's profit to be made. Yes. Yes. And yes. So a fool in his money are quickly parted. So the operation, did you feel like you were a part of parting people from their money initially? Or did it take you a while to figure out that that's what was going on? You know, I only worked in the nightclubs for that first season. So I did four months and I was in such a whirlwind that it really took me longer than it should to realize how many people it was. And I lean on the excuse. I was 25. But the reality is that you learned very quickly how the operations work. And after that first season of doing the nightclubs, you know, I moved on to different jobs. But yeah, I definitely, I recognized it and I participated in the benefit of the system for sure. So what different jobs? Where did you go after that? Like what does a person in Vegas do? Like. Well, here's the thing. So you've got Vegas and all of the debauchery, all of the vices that find themselves available there really create an environment for someone to pick up temp work in a million different ways. And so I fell into that. And what started out with, all right, well, if I can get a job serving champagne at a celebrity-only event, great. So in that case, I'm going to be paid a dollar a minute, $60 an hour to carry champagne around a room where celebrities are getting together for the latest awards show or someone's private birthday party. And so that was one of the gigs that I had. And so speaking to what you asked earlier, I really do feel like when people say, oh, what do you think of this celebrity? What do you think of this person? Well, chances are if they were big and if they were influential in the mid 2004, 2005, 2006 timeframe, I probably ran into them and it was really cool to be a fly on the wall. Some were great, some were not so great. What a great look like. Oh my gosh, I got to tell you my favorite story. Please. So all right. So this is skipping forward to 2008. I am out for my birthday. So at this time, I want to say 2008, double check me because the time could be a year off. But Red Rock Casino had just opened and George Clooney was a partial owner of this new station casino, which was off the strip. Station Casino caters more to locals, Destin. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. Yes. Off strip, it's on the kind of, there's one on each of the four corners, more or less of the Valley and people who work at a job and just want to go gamble at night. That's where they would go and hang out. Got it. Okay. So George Clooney has just partially owns this casino is there and I don't know it. I'm out for my birthday just having a normal night, but a host, a hostess who's now married to Tito Ortiz. But at the time, she is a cocktail waitress. Tito Ortiz. Yeah. Her name is Amber Nicole, wonderful girl. And I'm walking by Cherry, the nightclub there at Red Rock. And she waves me down and she says, Hey, Rocky, you know, you should come into the club. And so I'm like, Amber, I really appreciate it. But, you know, I'm not really into the nightclub thing. She goes, no, trust me. You should go in. Okay. I'll go in and just check it out for a second. You know, it's a kind gesture. So mind you, there's a line, a half a mile long outside and no one's being let in. So I walk in by myself to this, what seems to be a dark nightclub until I get truly inside. And when I go inside, I find a ton of atmosphere models that I know. A lot of girls are there. I don't see any guys, not a single guy in the entire place. So it's like a dating app. Right. So, so I'm like, this is the way I want to celebrate my birthday. So I sit down at one of these booths and there's just mild music playing, no, no major DJ. And I'm talking to girls that I've worked with in various capacities. And I'm drinking a cocktail and let's say a half an hour goes by. And then afterwards, everybody seems to be filtering out. And so I, along with the girls, start filtering out of the club. And we're walking past all of the people that are waiting to get in. And I see paparazzi, like shooting pictures. And I don't understand what's going on, but I'm really enjoying the fact that I have a private audience with six or seven girls that I know. So I'm soaking up this moment. We walk to an elevator. I get into an elevator with six or seven girls. And the next thing I know, the elevator opens to the penthouse at Red Rock. The girls start filtering out and I turn pale as I look in the center of this symmetrical penthouse at Red Rock and see George Clooney behind the bar. And I immediately kick into the reality like, oh gosh, I usually work these events. And this is definitely not professional. I've drank too much. I've happened upon his private, you know, sweet. This is not where I'm supposed to be. So I apologize. I say, oh, I'm so sorry. It's my mistake. I know a couple of these girls. I wrote the elevator. I shouldn't be here. I'll see myself out. And he goes out of his way to invite me in and says, hey, you know, come on in, grab a seat. Tell me your story. Tell me about yourself. George Clooney says this. George Clooney says this. Okay. For the next, you know, I don't want to expand too long, but legitimately 30 minutes. If it was a minute, it was 30 minutes. I talked to George Clooney and he is so engaging, so interested in my story. And you know, I've at this point, I've met a lot of celebrities. I understand the social dynamic of I'm going to engage with you. And then I'm going to find a reason. My assistant's going to come up and I'm going to have a reason to leave. And I am looking for every opportunity to allow him to do that. I'm looking for every opportunity for me to end a story and to get out. And he keeps reengaging like, let me make you a drink. You know, what do you like? You know, stay around for a while. So after 30 minutes, you know, it naturally finds its exit and I leave. And, you know, I met a lot of celebrities over the years and some of them weren't so great and some of them were, but that was a moment in which I was like, this is an authentic human that owed me nothing. There was no cameras around to see his kind gesture. I did sneak my way into his party and yet he was overly gracious and genuinely seemed interested in connecting with me for a minute. Amazing experience. That's crazy. Can you imagine what that would be like to be a person at that level where you can't go into public without someone recognizing you? Like you recognized him across the bar. And then I don't know. I think there would be some level of strangeness there for him. When he was engaging with you, what did it seem like? Did it seem like he was trying to reconnect with quote normal people or like, what did that feel like? Did you psycho analyze it? I guess it's my question. Of course. I mean, it's one of those things to where once again, I've worked with, I've worked with people and I've seen the way that this plays out and I do. I do completely have sympathy for people that are famous and get recognized everywhere because you know, it can be a lose-lose situation. Let's say that I walk in and I go to exit and he gives me a look like, what the heck? Which would be a reasonable response for a human to do. Like if I had the penthouse and some random guy comes in my suite, I might give him the what the heck look. But if you're George Clooney or if you're famous, you can't do that because then that guy, in this case, me walks out and goes, oh, well, he was rude. He was mean and he wasn't rude or mean. It's just he's a celebrity and you see him a certain way as a character in movies and then his five second natural reaction strikes you the wrong way. So it led me in many cases when I've interacted with people to be more sympathetic to the fact that they have a persona that they have to put on. They have to present themselves a certain way all the time. Like they leave their house, their hair has got to be combed. And so with all that in mind, I really genuinely believe that this is a human and that's the best way I can describe it. They really wanted to connect. It says nothing about me. Maybe if anything, he recognized that, oh, well, this guy's probably had one too many drinks. He recognizes me, but he doesn't, you know, he's not trying to press his way into the party. Quite the opposite from the moment he wants to get out. Maybe I can at least test with a couple of questions to see if he's you know, willing to have a human conversation without any risk. There's no cameras around here and the chances are he might not even remember it. I hope that's the case. Either way, from my end, it seemed very authentic. I was very impressed with them. And, you know, obviously I'm telling that story because it made an impression on me that, okay, you can be as famous as this guy and still, still be human. Still have these moments. Well, what you said is still true because there was a lose, it was a lose, lose situation, but it's 15 years later and you just told me that story. So the way he acted in that moment really, really mattered because you could have just as easily told, you know, oh, he kicked me out of the whatever, you know? Yeah, that's amazing because for him, it's just a Tuesday or whatever it was. But for you, it was the time you saw this individual. That's interesting. So, what about the weird encounters? You don't have to use names if you don't want to. I mean, it's nice to give credit where it's due. You don't have to give blame where it's due. But what's some of the weird stuff you saw from people who didn't care whether anybody was watching or not? Oh, gosh. Yeah, I probably won't use names because if I've learned anything from my interactions, it's that, you know, I definitely don't want to represent someone who is a human by a bad moment that they had. And I don't know if this was the first time they did something like this or if this is something to do all the time, but I only at least saw them once. But one thing stands out. I was mentioning rehab, the party pool earlier. And once again, one of these little side jobs that I got, at this point, I wasn't bartending or bar backing. I was paid to make sure that the crowd moved in and moved out. And that also meant in some sort of security means making sure that the right girls were allowed into the club and the ones that were not were at least filtered into a certain area. What do you mean by right girls? Oh, gosh. I was afraid you would ask that. Yeah. There's no there's no good way of answering that. You judged people by how they look. Yes, I did. For money? Yes, I did. At least you got paid. That's okay. Moving on. So, no, what was your instruction? What was your commissioning? Like what do they tell you? What's your type? Well, to be fair, the judging wasn't truly on my level. Basically, there would be a celebrity that would have access to this cabana and the celebrity would get to choose who came in and who left. And I wasn't security. I wasn't a bouncer. I never put my hands on anybody, but I just kindly said, I think it might be time for you to leave. And that was as far as it went. And then security would come in if need be. So, I wasn't truly doing the judging, but it is interesting to know that at some level, that sort of decision making happens in a place like Vegas. It's interesting to know that there's an organized way that you are either accepted or not based on things that you can't control. Like you are quote unquote, beautiful. Therefore, you get to have access to certain things. You, however, guy from Alabama are not beautiful. Therefore, you do not have- He's got a bit of a shovel head, doesn't he? He's got a bit of a shovel head. I mean, it's very interesting to know that that sort of thing is not only organized, but there's a market behind it. Like there's market forces at work. People are getting paid to do that. And so, I'm not judging your character or anything like that, Rocky. But I think it's very important to know that that sort of thing exists in the world. It definitely does. It definitely does. Yeah. Did you ever see anything that was unsettling? So, here's the thing about growing up in Vegas. And I say growing up because my 20s were spent in Vegas and I had spent the early part of my 20s in the military. And so, I was completely isolated from culture. I remember the USO came and they showed Lord of the Rings too to us when I was overseas in the desert. And I remember looking around to all the Marines and we were all struck by it. Because we were like, I've never heard of Lord of the Rings one. We've been in the desert. There's a second one. What is this? So, culturally, I had been separated for the early 2000s. And then this juxtaposition to where now I find myself in Vegas. And there's a lot that's unsettling. And I'm trying to measure like, is this unsettling? For me, everyone seems to be okay with this. Also noting that a lot of the populace has no idea what it looks like behind the curtain. But it was very unsettling to a point to where, you know, sadly, it took a little longer than it should have. But I grew out of taking these jobs, taking the opportunity to be a fly on the wall. Because, you know, as you're in this environment, you can't help but recognize patterns and recognize, okay, this is unsettling. The few times I've been in Vegas, I remember one time I had a meeting and I was, it was an international meeting and we were talking about rockets. And there was a museum there. It was the Atomic Bomb Museum in Vegas. And we met there during the day and this was right after one of my children were born. I wanted to be home so bad. Like, I wanted to not be in Vegas. And I remember we went out to eat one night as a group. And I remember thinking, it feels like there's a layer of veneer over everything that's not real. Like, if you go just below the surface, the thin surface of marble, it's like evil. It felt dark and it scared me. And it's like, people want to buy into this thin shell of a lie that this is reality on the outside. But once you got below, it's like the grossest parts of the human heart were there. And I don't know that I was given it a fair shake because I was homesick because one of my children, like, I remember standing in line at the airport on the way home thinking, I have been apart from my child longer than I have been with my child. And I remember my heart aching in that moment. And that just left a weird taste in my mouth about Vegas in general. Do you have that? Because how many years did you live there? So I lived off and on, but I maintained a place there for 14 years. I think the draw to Vegas, I grew in my career and I did different things. I had originally desired to pursue acting and I did some modeling. And I remember getting to a place of thinking, well, now I've reached a point where I've interacted with enough actors and I've interacted with enough celebrities to realize, this isn't naturally a gift. It can be. But there are plenty of people that are miserable and not only is it a veneer, but you get to see them put it on and off. If I'm working iHeartRadio and my job is to run artists back and forth to the stage, I'm in that unique position to where I'm in their dressing room waiting for them to go and they're one person and then their publicist walks in, their manager walks in, and you get to see them convert and now they're putting their hair down again. And I remember being just so sympathetic once again to the reality that how do you get to be a human? How do you get to be flawed and to have foibles that aren't going to be used against you and these celebrities, they didn't get to do that. And so not only do you have the veneer that exists in the marketing campaign that is all of Vegas, but individually for the headliners and for the artists that come in there, there's a, I would say a thick veneer that they have to put on an extra layer on top of that when they come to Vegas. Like an image to maintain? Yes. Well, undoubtedly, like if you get a contract with your publicist where you're going to show up at a nightclub at one o'clock in the morning and you're an artist that is trying to maintain your music career, but maybe you're not as a hard rocker as you used to be, well, Vegas is still Vegas. And so I'm going to need you to put on your party hat and go out to the nightclub for two hours at one o' the morning. And it is part of the darkness that you speak to. And I've lived there for 14 years, but as the last few years, I did convert from anything related to the bars and the clubs to doing other work there in Vegas. But it's one of those things to where Vegas really can trap you because if you'll show up for work and if you're hardworking, there's always work. If you're not starstruck and you don't, you know, you're not enamored with fame, then you get hired all the more often to work with people because they recognize like this person is going to honor the lines. They're not going to sneak pictures. Do you think it would be better for everyone if that place or places like that just went away? Or do you think it's better that for the most part, it is contained to one little place in the middle of the desert and it doesn't leak into everywhere else, but maybe it provides some kind of pressure release valve for stuff people want to do? So the purge question is what you're asking me. That's an interesting, it's an interesting question. And I don't know. So the heart is wicked, like man's heart is wicked. And so the idea that you could get rid of Vegas and that it wouldn't pop up somewhere else, it's just not a reality. It is going to exist. It does exist. I think Vegas, as much as I would like to say, it shouldn't exist. We should get away from it. The reality is, is that it happens overseas in much cedier ways. You go to Vegas, you know what you're going to get. Like Dustin said, you show up in Vegas, you feel it. You don't have to come very often. You've been there twice. You recognize, oh, that's what this is. People are letting go of any morality they have and they're purposely coming here to lower their inhibitions and do something that they otherwise would regret in an environment in which they're friends and family who know them and care for them and wouldn't approve of these decisions. Aren't they? You know, in an ideal world, I would love that Vegas didn't exist. But sadly, I don't think that's possible. So tell me about some of the good things there. So here's the great aspects of Vegas. I love the location of Vegas. I love the fact that if you'll show it for work, the pay has always been great in Vegas. To make $60 an hour in Vegas is readily available. And let's say you work hard for two weeks, three weeks a month, you take that money, you go on a road trip and you're within a four or five hour drive from the beaches of San Diego or the best snow skiing in Utah. Also, I happen to find a really great church when I was in Vegas. And this is a cool story. I find myself baptized in Woodstock, Georgia and the pastor of that church, Johnny Hunt, starts a church in Las Vegas. He plants a church in Las Vegas. And he has a pastor that suggested to him from Alabama and his name is Vance Pittman. And he sends Vance Pittman and a church planning team to Las Vegas and they start a church. So I'm from Georgia, baptized in Woodstock with Johnny Hunt. And I find myself in Vegas. And I'm at that age where I recognize the darkness that's around me. And I recognize that I'm missing my relationship with God. And so I start looking for churches to connect with. And I go to two or three churches and don't really find a good home. And I visited a church called Hope and Vance Pittman gets on stage and he introduces himself and he says, hey, you know, we've been a church for two or three years now. And this church was founded out of Woodstock, Georgia from Johnny Hunt. And we're just so glad you visitors are here today. And so I've often said this. I don't know if you would agree, but people that choose faith in Vegas, they don't do it in Alabama. They don't do it in my case in Georgia. You're doing it in a cesspool. And so if you're seeking that relationship with God, maybe even because you have witnessed the darkness that is readily available, it draws you even closer to that, that need and that desire with a relationship. And so for me, it was a great opportunity for me to meet great people. I made great friendships, not only in that church, but other people in the community as well, who didn't see, you know, all it was glitter as gold. So they, they also were able to live in it without being a part of it. What about redemptive things on the strip? Is there anything that you like about what goes on there or what it is? You mean hookers for Jesus? Is that a thing? That is a thing. Huh? That is a thing. I mean, it happened in the Bible. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I say that lightly and I don't judge the organization. I don't know anything about it. I just met a member one day when I was walking home from work and a girl with a certain look came up and I tried to dismiss myself and she corrected me and said, No, no, no, I think you got it wrong. Please, please read this card. I am a believer and I want to share this message. Okay. Well, I'm not familiar with your organization. I'm not sure that I know enough about it to even judge what's going on here, but it's definitely a unique take that I wouldn't experience in another city. Yeah, I didn't see that coming. No, that's interesting. Man, that's crazy, dude. So you're out of there now, right? You got out? I did. I exited out. So in the craziness that is COVID, it is one of the greatest gifts for me because I don't know that I would have ever escaped this money that's coming in this temp environment where you can make good money and it's contract work and it's coming in and out. It would have slowly faded away and I wouldn't have had an exit strategy, but when you work in international travel and conventions and COVID hits, I literally got sent home in the middle of a contract and all of the future contracts got canceled in an instant and that was the catalyst along with a great friendship that allowed for me to escape. Well, congratulations. Thank you very much. I am so grateful to be out. Yeah, you don't even realize that how affected you are from living in a place like Vegas until you get away from it and just your interactions with neighbors and people that haven't lived in this environment, how they treat you and how they treat one another. It's a gift. I found it to be the transience of the place that most affected me when I lived there and we weren't there long. Our oldest daughter was conceived there and we still have her with us thus disproving the what stays in Vegas mantra. She's with us still and that's about it. We didn't take much else with us from our Vegas experience. A couple of friendships. One, two. Yeah, two. And that was it. We didn't really bring our stuff. We were ready to be done. It's the only place I've ever moved away from where I have a photo of me up on a ridge with the town in the background and me with a pair of sandals that I am dusting off together next to my U-Haul as I leave the city. It's the only place I've ever lived where, yeah, sure, good things happened, but at least for me, it just felt off and never felt like I was actually there. It's never fit for whatever reason. I don't lay that at the feet of anyone, in particular. It was just a very different thing and that transience is what stood out. It's like everybody was on their way to something else. And so all of the houses were metal boxes with Stucco on the outside and they all had garages that face the front and you would pull into your exclusive neighborhood because they all are and then you would drive your metal box into the garage metal box and get out of the car metal box and go into the house metal box. And then the next morning you get into the car metal box and drive to the parking metal box and then go to the work metal box and then get back in the car and repeat. You just never saw anybody. It was so bizarre how the scorching heat in the summer and the weird hours people worked and the odd economics of it and the fact that everybody was rolling to the next thing. There were exceptions. I just didn't run into a lot of people who were like, you know, let's sit down and think about what all this means. What are we doing? What is the point here? What are we going for? And I'm sure those people were there and that it's probably my fault that I missed them and didn't make the effort to connect. But it seemed a little tougher to find that when I was there. Should I tell him Rocky or should you? Oh, dang it. Go for it. It's because you're ugly. You're not wrong. I'm just kidding. That's a joke. I never got to go to any of the sexy parties. To be clear, Matt, I'm referencing an earlier part of the conversation. You're fine. I need to apologize to you because I know sometimes people get upset when I get funny with you. I'm sorry. I give you an ending permission to make fun of my dumb face. Same here. My friends. My dad and I have decided we have square heads. And if we ever need to head about somebody and like one of those 1980s fights scenes or whatever, we have to turn our head to the corner and hit on the corner because that's the strongest part of our heads. Yeah. Rocky, you talked about the convention thing. I think that's pretty interesting. I'm not even sure I totally understand it. What do you do at conventions? So I kind of fell into conventions as well. So I'm taking these jobs serving champagne at parties and someone tells me, oh, well, if you're engaging with people, there's a lot of conventions that come in town and they hire guys and girls to generate leads for companies. And so in essence, you're going to get paid two or $300 and you show up and you spend eight, nine hours a day and you're getting emails for these companies. And from there, I found that there is a position for a speaker that gets on stage and speaks on behalf of the company. And with this job, you're taking a company's marketing vision and they obviously have marketing managers and they have people that know this information. But oftentimes they're not interested in presenting on stage or maybe they're more purposed to actually host meetings privately with individuals or companies they want to do business with. So they will hire a presenter to get on stage and present their marketing pitch once, twice an hour, six, seven times a day. And so I progressed into presenting for these conventions. And so I got to work for a lot of Fortune 500 companies and with the exception of Orlando, Chicago and Dallas, San Diego, possibly Vegas is the premier place to go. And so is that acting? Is that thinking on your feet? What do you actually do? What do you need to be good at to get that kind of work? Oh, gosh. So here's the thing. And once like everything else, there's a marketing pitch. So there's coursework that you can do, you can pour hours into seeing if you can do ear prompted or teleprompting as a career. But the reality is, is it's as simple as do you have attention deficit? Can you watch the news and turn the volume up loud enough to where you can clearly hear it and then repeat back to the anchor what he's saying to you with a one or two second delay? If you can do that, if you have that skill set, then it's very easy. And then obviously, you do master the craft by being able to improv. People are going to heckle. People are going to cut you off. The mic is going to cut out your ear prompter is going to stop recording, whatever the case may be. But I got a phone call. There was a point in which I not only was doing the lead generation and making two or $300, but I would get contact and they would say, Hey, can you manage a group of five or six guys to do this? Great. And I would take 10% and I would hire five or six guys work with me. So in the process, I get a phone call from Kodak and they say, Hey, we've heard you're the guy in Vegas, you can get us four or five people to gather leads for us through $300. Sure. They said, we also want to present her. And so I'd introduce myself to Kodak as Joseph Fane, my legal name and where I collected my paychecks. And so I introduced myself and they said that they needed a presenter and I asked them the details and they said, Well, it pays this much. And we need someone that's going to do a presentation for Kodak six or seven times an hour for three days. And when I heard the number, I said, I know exactly the person to book for that. His name is Rocky. And he'll do a great job. So I studied really hard for a couple of weeks and fake it till you make it. I went and the client was well pleased. And I got a little bit better each and every time. And so I did that for so you kind of hired yourself. I did. I heard myself and I worked for 11 of the 14 years as a presenter and got better at it each and every time, hopefully. That's awesome. Hey, this episode of the podcast is brought to you by you. That is the patrons of the program who sport the show at patreon.com slash no dumb questions. Seriously, the way this thing works out, you are a huge motivation in us staying after it and making this thing go. Destin, you can match for that, right? Absolutely. Yeah, it brings stability to what we do in a way that's hard to describe. We don't have to worry about the business model or anything like that. We can pay Tina. We can pay people that need to be paid and get it all done. It's a huge, huge deal. And I'm sorry, I was not trying to do fun there. This is naturally happened. But one thing I will say is I was reading in the comments the other day and someone was mentioning that their winged hasar sticker. We sent out a bunch of stickers for people that support on patreon for the winged hasars because that's what we call the the patreon supporters here. Some people are saying they want an opportunity to buy an extra sticker because one guy like traded in his laptop or he sold his car or something. I don't know, but it's you can grow attached to a sticker like that. And I think we need to offer an opportunity to do this. Yeah, I mean, we've got a stack of them left, right? Yeah. So what if on patreon, patreon.com slash no dumb questions, we make a post on there that's a patron only access post. And while come up with a link or something like that that shows people where to go to get a sticker. Perfect. Like if you want another one of those winged hasars stickers, which is a really cool design, I think that's a that's a good way to do it, right? Yeah, we'll just do the thing at cost, right? We need to make money on a sticker. Yeah, exactly. Cool. Yeah, I dig it. But all I'd say, thank you again, winged hasars. Thank you everybody who sports the program at patreon.com slash no dumb questions. You really are why this happens. We appreciate you. Absolutely. We'll leave a link on the patreon page. If you need a new sticker, go check it out and we're grateful. Back to the conversation. So what do you make of all this? Oh gosh. Well, I mean, there's a lot that I took away from my experience in Vegas. I think the overarching thing that I took away was, I mean, not all that glitters is gold and quite the opposite. Most of what glitters glitters at a price. And you're not making it and you're going to pay for it. For everybody who's benefiting for all the lights that are shining, you know, someone's riding the bike backstage pedaling harder than they should to keep them glowing. Yeah, I mean, and that I try not to be calloused about marketing. But as we've said, multiple ways and multiple times, when it's based on looks, when it's based on youth, when it's based on these frivolous things that are fading, there's a darkness to it. If you had the option to go back and not be in Vegas for all that time and not do that work, would you opt for something different? Or did you get something out of it that makes you glad you did it? That's a mixed question. I wouldn't be the person I am if I didn't experience Vegas. I mean, I wouldn't see so clearly that at a time I wanted to be famous at a time I wanted to be an actor and I walk away clearly knowing that's not my path. I have no desire to do that. But I'd be remiss without mentioning that I would have loved to escape 10 years earlier. You know, I left the military. I found myself in Vegas and I didn't see an exit strategy and, you know, like you said, that transient work comes on a contract basis just frequent enough to where you don't really see an exit out. But I take the good and I definitely wish I would have got out sooner. Okay, I got one more question for you. If somebody is listening to this and they're like, well, I still like Las Vegas. That's somewhere I was going to go in a couple months with my friends and we were going to have fun and stuff. What advice would you give them for their next weekend in Vegas? Oh, gosh, now you've got me thinking philosophically, I don't want to get too deep. But the reality is, is that you can bypass all of the drama that is Vegas by simply being you when you go. I mean, sadly, the thing that's flawed with Vegas is people go there to escape. They go there to be someone else. They think that that's going to make their life better. They think that they're going to experience something. They're going to meet JLo in the bathroom and their life is going to be better because they can tell that story. And as someone who's, well, I almost went the wrong direction. I have not gone to the bathroom with JLo. As someone who's been in an environment where you get to interact with celebrities and you see this behind the curtain, like, it's fake, it's shallow. No one's fulfilled. The person that's performing is doing a job and they want to go home to their family and truly have a deep connection. The person that's serving you a cocktail, like they're there for that 20% of that $3,000 bill, they don't really want to talk to you. It's easily solved. If you go to Vegas and you don't leave your soul at the door, then you're going to be fine. But sadly, that's why people go to Vegas. And that's why it's so corrupt. This whole story reminds me of the story, the prodigal son, not saying you're the prodigal son, but someone goes somewhere to kind of make their fame and fortune or whatever. And it ends up getting squandered a little bit. And then they end up getting broken down by the attempt. That's just kind of what it makes me feel like. I don't know if that's accurate or not, but... It made me feel like the island of Lost Boys in Pinocchio. Really? Yeah. And I think you hit the nail on the head, Rocky, the pressure. You can even feel it at an upscale shopping mall a little bit. A pressure is so quick to weigh on you, regardless of how confident you are to measure up and to be the thing that all of the feedback loop is telling you to be, to try to imitate this thing or the other thing. But we're pretty weird with things that are trendy and fashionable. I was talking with a buddy just at lunch about pop stars and how there seems to be this cultural obsession with using them up like a battery. I can hear it really going. It's like, oh, this is fresh things. This is great. This is fun. This is awesome. Maybe album number number three. We're starting to get a little bit sick of it. And we're more into the phase where we're excited to see this come unglued and break and fall apart. And then you get the empty drained out battery and you can dispose of that and be done with this. There isn't a pot of gold at the end of that particular rainbow. I think most people who've chased it deeply and most people who have drunk deeply of that cup would tell you it hurts and it is not as good a deal. You cannot keep up with whatever is cool forever and have that be an identity at some point. There's something that makes you use some set of ideas, passions and pursuits and compassion. So I appreciate hearing you say, lean into that stuff. That's the anti Vegas. But on the positive side, there's cool architecture. There's great art, great acts, great theater. I mean, there's stuff there that's at least kind of fun to take in and enjoy, right? Oh, absolutely. Like if you're a nature lover, like world class rock climbing, hiking, you're within driving distance of a lot of major national parks and you drive down to California very easily for the weekend. So there's a lot of great things about in an outburger everywhere. One on every corner. Yes. Unlimited in an outburger. Animal fries. Yes. Yeah. So I suppose it's like anywhere. I mean, my limited experience living there, diving deeply into your experience living there. And you and I've been friends for a long time, Rocky, but these are almost entirely new stories to me. You do not name drop. It takes me intentionally asking you specifically to tell me a story about a thing. And even then you'll weasel to try to avoid telling me in order to hear about anybody who did anything or anybody you ran into. But then when I start badgering you about it enough and you let down the guard for a minute, it's ridiculous. You met everyone. Tell me about a famous rapper, famous rapper. Go 50 Cent. That is the name of one. Yeah. I mean, I didn't understand the question. Who did I meet? What did you do there with 50 Cent? So I helped record an interview. He was doing an interview for MTV and I was a grip in essence. I mean, once again, I'm always the lowest guy in the totem pole in the room, but I got to be in the room and then I got to see him when the cameras weren't rolling and seemed like a seem like a really nice guy. Famous athlete. Go Michael Jordan. What? Tell me. So Michael Jordan's a really cool story. His manager at the time was in Vegas at Caesar's Palace and really needed a coke. And so I as simple as it sounds. The bartenders were packed. I just went and grabbed a coke gave it to her. I didn't know that it was Michael Jordan's manager. And she said, Hey, there's a celebrity golf tournament. It's all celebrities. Would you be interested in coming down to the Bahamas, the Atlantis resort? And it'll be all celebrities with a small group of models, host that will be there for the event. And that was of an event I did six or seven years in a row. What? Yeah. With Michael Jordan six or seven years in a row? Well, I wouldn't say I hung out with him, but I was close to friends swapped back. Yeah, I was in the room. He definitely doesn't know my name. Did you? What about a famous country artist? George Strait. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what happened? Well, I worked for another one of the gigs that I had. I worked for iHeartRadio up until COVID really. And I was a runner. So I would run artists to the stage. I would pick them up at the hotel and take them to the venue or take them in a golf cart from the venue to the stage back to the dressing room, whatever the case may be. So, you know, George Strait, wonderful guy. I hopefully am bringing up names of people that stand out for good reasons. Just a great guy, carry under wood, beautiful spirit. From what I know, once again, you're interacting with them, you know, once or twice, maybe you get the luck of if they show up the show, you know, multiple years, you get to meet them a few times. But yeah. Famous engineer. Go. Dustin Sandlin. No, no, boom. I'm fired on you sucker. I just dropped. I dropped the biggest name. I'm a humble rocket scientist. Boom. Shut up. No, like a real engineer. Not a, not some plays on YouTube. Well, you know, this is interesting. I don't, I don't recall his name because I'm terrible with German names, but I did work a convention with a engineer that works at the collider and was interested enough. And he was kind enough. We went to dinner afterwards and he tried to explain the complexity of physics. And I was lost for three quarters of the conversation. But from what I understood of what they were doing with the Higgs boson and all of that stuff, it was intriguing and obviously a brilliant man that was kind enough to invite me to dinner. Wow. It's amazing. He had an answer. He had an answer. It's a real answer. You were joking. Yeah, that's amazing. So not only, and you can look this guy up, this guy is part of the development team for the capacity with Silicon chips to transfer very close to immediate timing on teleprompters from a remote location. So like in a different country, you can feed a teleprompter a signal. Now, obviously this technology exists everywhere now, but this was what 10 years ago that I met him. Wow. And one of the founders, originators of it. Yeah. That's cool, man. Yeah. How about a famous news personality? Tommy Lauren. Okay. Is that count? Well, I mean, I think so. Yeah. Well, and that one's kind of a layup because she went to school at UNLV. So she was a local before she was famous as she is today. She was a student at UNLV. And I just happened to know a couple of professors there at UNLV that were in that department. Wow. Politician. Well, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George Bush. They're, I guess they count. Yeah. And that's the strange thing about Vegas is that individuals are coming and they're going to be there for something. And if it's a summit, they need somebody that's going to pour the water. And if you're willing to be, you know, the lowest guy on the totem pole and I am, then I found myself in the room. So it's kind of cool. So last question I have, I mean, clearly you guys met there. How did you guys meet in Vegas? Well, Matt and I met through a mutual friend. We have a friend named Shelby, one of the greatest guys I've ever met, Salt of the Earth. And I believe, well, Matt, you can take it from here. You met Shelby through, through a church. It's church. I worked at church there. And I had met once again, another job that I had, I worked at a rehabilitation center. And I had met someone who was in relationship with, with Shelby. And I told him I was interested in film and I didn't know much about it, but I wanted to be involved and learn. So that's how I met Shelby. And then Shelby later introduced me to Matt. So we were there at the same time, running in the same circles at the same time, but we did not meet in Vegas. Oh, interesting. So you met afterwards. Yep. And all of this mutual friendship is what made the drug stopper possible. The most epic piece of filmmaking history. All drug stopper history. For the longest time, Rocky, Matt only referred to you as, quote, the drug stopper, because you played that role in that little short film that you guys made. Well, I mean, it's the greatest acting that I've ever been a part of. So I'm just really proud and drugs are bad. They're still bad. That's the theme of the movie. It's the one bit of acting that you'll show people. You know what? It's as funny as it is. I think obviously the writing is incredible. The fact that you were able to put this together in such a short period of time. And when I tell people, oh, yeah, my friend Matt wrote this, directed it, produced it, acted in it, edited it. Oh, and we filmed it over a series of like three weekends, two of which in Wyoming and one in Vegas, you know, people love it. You know, obviously they probably are just saying they love it more because I'm in it and I'm showing it to them, but I had a great time with it. If you Google the drug stopper, it comes up on YouTube and it's got like 6,000 views. That's it. It deserves so much more than that. But you know, it's what's interesting. It creates everything. We just made it and put it on the internet. Nobody watched it and we didn't care. It was so far ahead of its time. It was a 22 minute short film. That's before YouTube wanted a 22 minute long video to be on YouTube. You know, the algorithm has changed and now that's in style. Interesting. Look at this. Well, let get the blue moonlight and then you get, you guys did a good job with this. Yeah, it's, I mean, we just literally called in a ton of favors. I think the budget for the blood and the fake drugs that my daughter helped me whip up. That's about all we paid. I think I bought some pizzas one night. That was it. I bought a box fan from Walmart to have my friend Todd get chewed up in. I think so. Yeah, the budget was probably like 50 bucks. Rocky, this was fun, man. I've got to take my kids to a trash panda's game, but thanks for giving me a little bit of insight into what it was like to actually live in Vegas. I've only visited and I had no idea there was so much social engineering going on. I had no idea that, you know, all this stuff was planned out for people when they get there. Well, I mean, frankly, I don't hang out in those types of areas, but it's interesting to know that that exists. And a lot of times things are different than what people think they are. Very, very true. Yeah, this was fun. I appreciate you guys giving me a call. Yeah. And I particularly am taking away from this conversation and appreciation that a lot of the things that might make people feel like they don't measure up, that might make people feel like they should be self conscious and they're not cool enough or attractive enough are absolutely fake. Hey, you're probably cooler than you think. Absolutely. Cool. Thanks, man.
