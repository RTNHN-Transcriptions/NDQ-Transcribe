I don't know why we're disclosing that but yes Well, please give us your time trust us. This is make this podcast a priority. We don't have any plan whatsoever No, I I actually think that's fun because I'm gonna pull up a topic that I think you would be able to do off the top of your head and I would like to disclose it this way. Do you remember me telling you like hey? I got a topic you're gonna be simultaneously proud of me and angry at me for pulling up this topic. Do you remember that? Oh? I do remember you saying that. Yeah, and I'm nervous. So All right, just hit me. I guess I secretly Consumed Persian fire by Tom Holland and I'm ready to talk about the Persian invasion of Greece You did I'm not that why would I be mad at you because the best thing ever That would be like if I went was like I learned how the rockets work. Let's figure out how to put a man on the moon Okay, it's not quite that grand a scale, but it's still cool Yeah, I'm ready to go and I just didn't give you any warning So that means anything we talk about today is gonna have to come right out of your head. You have no chance to prepare. Oh No, okay. Uh you see you see Well, just like just remember that I am at least a nice person All right, I learned about Persia in a way that I never I never thought I would think to learn about Persia. It's incredible Is it you just went and devoured that whole book the audiobook? I assume? Yeah, yeah, 12 and a half hours. Yep Did you love it? Very interesting. There were a lot of names the Greek names were harder for me to Embrace it's like the first part of the book talks about why I guess we just need to frame this for The third chair because we we don't want you to feel like you have to go listen to this book but uh, it's cool. I enjoyed it. I think we can have this conversation in a way that's informative and Helps other people learn about Persia and Greece specifically in the 490s to 480 BC timeframe, right? This is gonna be delightful. You're gonna do history But I would like to ask for one ground rule before we do it Okay, and that is that I would like for you to Literally jump in Whenever you want right over the top of me if you want to when you remember something from the book Even if I'm explaining it because I want to know what stood out to you and what popped. Does that make sense? Yeah, so you're giving me permission to be an idiot No, no, not that at all. It's just The history is a present that you only get to unwrap once and then after you've unwrapped it The only way you can experience that joy again is to watch somebody you care about unwrap it for themselves And you're doing that right now with Persia So I just want you to interrupt me and I want you to jump in when you got something and we'll compare notes on it It'll be fun. Okay. I'll do it. I mean I genuinely enjoyed this so that'll be easy to do just you can give me some grace Yeah, I won't I'll do what I can do cool My pleasure, okay So I'm gonna ask you to set the table here opening question How did we end up with a grease? How did we end up with a Persia? And how did we end up with them feeling like they needed to fight against each other? Oh That's hard Well, it's it's interesting because Persia. Okay, so I'm thinking about a map. So if you're looking at Europe Uh the bottom right hand side of Europe you've got grease and it's yes like just to the left of Turkey And you've got this really and that's kind of like the transition between Europe and Asia And you and I have discussed many times that the Bosporus and and the the helispont and all that area in there Like you reroll the dice or you know, just rerun the earth simulation. There's always going to be war in that area, right? I think so Why do you think so? Because it's the intersection of three continents I think Jerusalem is always going to be contested. The holy land is always going to be hot If you put a heat map of human activity Around the planet. It doesn't even matter where you start life on the planet that intersection Is the intersection of the most connected land In the whole world. Let me think about what else you got you get the western hemisphere. So you got Panama Well, sure enough. That's a strategic point. We figured that out. It's going to be a strategic point every time But it's just not as much land. It's not as much stuff being funneled through this area as Asia Africa and Europe Everybody's going to end up there. It's going to be hot and that heat map is going to radiate out From basically Jerusalem Syria Lebanon Palestine Israel That's going to be the hottest spot on the map because that's where everybody has to go In order to get where they're going to pursue riches and relationships with other cultures And as you go out with concentric circles from the center of the holy land you get Still pretty hot like you know bright orange kind of activity And I think Greece is in that part of the concentric circle lots of activity Yeah, and and these two Cultures were completely opposed in how they think about the world you had western thought and yet eastern thought like the greeks They believed in freedom and They they were trying out this new thing called democracy And this whole concept of we can lead ourselves Was very very interesting. The one thing I took for this entire book is We are repeating greek history right now because Well, I mean this is what just kept coming To the surface to me because the greeks were awesome And powerful and you've got the spartans who are down there and uh is it called? Laconia is that how you say that? Very good. Yeah And so laconic wit or a laconic statement is That that pithy little spartan comeback Like if the king of purgia the king of kings the king Of the meads and the purgians of and all the different titles and everything breaker of chains Comes to your people and if he does this you will suffer this and you remember the reply of the spartans according to harada this right? If Yeah, uh-huh. So good. Yes, so good Yeah, or if like lay down your weapons and they were like mola and la be come and take them So yeah, so interesting so You've got these greeks that are amazing and they're they're incredible warriors and I remember in a previous episode You were explaining to me how bad sparta would have been to live in and you're right man Uh, it's all about Hey, you are a warrior from day one of your birth. I mean what what does your I don't know man The spartans just explain them to me because I just read the book. I just consumed it But for the third chair just tell what it would have been like to be a spartan I will and just real quick again. Thank you for reading the book, dude. Yeah, so cool. I would have fun Surprise. I had no idea. This is coming. I still don't understand the part where you're like Tell me i'm gonna be mad at you or something. It's just it's great. How delightful Well, I thought you would be upset because I wanted to talk about it And you weren't ready to talk about it like I didn't know if you wanted to brush up on stuff So history is so big. I'll never be ready to talk about it Okay, I could brush up on everything and study really hard and it's I mean you're talking about most of the known world Is in play in this gigantic epic war And really this whole gigantic mess started 150 years earlier There's just too much to know I can get the broad stroke So now you could have given me a year to prepare and I wouldn't have felt ready So it's cool. We'll just take what we get but you asked about sparta Well, what a brutal place to grow up. I mean, it's uh Cog in the wheel. I guess is the way to think of it So it's interesting to me that people associate Democracy and freedom with the greeks in this conflict between the greeks and the purgians And they imagine that sparta was this ambassador of Freedom and democracy and kind of they weren't They don't think many people who live in western democracies today would feel very at home In ancient sparta. No, I think it would feel horrible Not okay I'm gonna get my sources confused because I've consumed a lot of material about Persia over the last couple years and then stuffing College grad school all of that. So I don't remember what comes from tom holland exactly Did he talk about the spartan broth the gruel that they ate Yeah, a little bit he talked about that Fast-forwarding all the way to the end after the final battle where they went and they took over the tent of the king And they had the the servants of Persia make them a meal And then they compared it to the food that they had And they were like, what the heck why's he invading us? He's got all this. What's he why's he even do why? And so they were just laughing at how bad their food was compared to The Persians and I thought that was really interesting What were you gonna tell me about the gruel? I think the gruel Is very emblematic of sparta in general if you want to understand sparta look at their food They ate this disgusting black broth That they had figured out over the years is the kind of thing that would give you the right energy for battle in the right disposition and It was sort of a rejection of pleasure to eat that food We eat to live and fight. We don't live and fight to eat right? I mean those were very different sets of motivations And and sparta was rough and they were they were a weird outlier In the rest of greece. It looks so little on a map when you look at it now with the whole world into you But it's very different. It's a lot like the black hills of south dakota where everything's really Dolce And you can just travel a couple of miles and things are very very different Because of how tight the valleys are and how abrupt the mountains are and you've got all of these Different currents and climates with three seas contacting the pelipanesian peninsula and the adicon peninsula the two peninsula's there of southern greece And so you've got all these different weather patterns and you got different seas and you got different climate and people really lived very differently even though by car on an interstate they only lived 15 minutes apart by today's travel times And so athens was a very different animal than sparta. They were not an empire They were not one thing they were a whole bunch of city states with their own style and their own sensibilities about love and sex and marriage and war and politics and art and Poetry and heroism and they came together and found ways to be cooperative under this larger threat of Persia coming to town when they needed to be like they hated each other but They absolutely hated each other but when when it came right down to it They're like okay, uh spartans you guys are really good at land warfare and um I mean prior to the Persians invading the they weren't good at nobody was good at Naval battles, but was it thermistically is that said hey? We need we need ships And yeah, so they made them And everybody's like why aren't we making these ships again? What and then it turned out to be a huge deal and so they they kind of got this and he was up in athens right And uh he was so they they got all this figured out and they're like all right you guys are gonna land warfare we're gonna do the navy thing and We're gonna figure out how to do all this and then when it comes right down to it We're gonna band together long enough to whip these Persian dudes and that's what they did and uh That's a primer. I would say on the Greek side, right? Uh, yeah, that's great man. Yeah, so what about the Persian side? Where did they come from? Who are they? the Persians are Interesting so one of the one of the first great leaders to unify everyone was Cyrus and very good he unified everybody And uh, well, he unified a lot of people and everybody was like, well, this is the great king And this is the person that's going to make it all go down and then when he died Everybody's like, what's up? I don't what's happening now And then they had this dude for a short period of not kambisis is that his name? kambisis is the second the oldest son of syrus. Yeah, yeah, and so there was there was kambisis in there like all right So he's going to be the king but There was this this Group of conspirators that were like, uh, yeah, he's not gonna be the king and so they got together How many were there seven seven conspirators? Yeah These seven conspirators got together and like all right. We're gonna go kill this dude We're gonna be the ones and so They just were you're lumping two things together. Oh kambisis had a brother named bardia. Oh, that's it and bardia and kambisis Cyrus could see this could be a difficult succession Okay, so we sent bardia way east and had him govern bactria and some other very important eastern provinces and He sort of positioned the direction of conquest in the army for kambisis in the early going toward Wait, did I do that backwards? Yeah toward the west to go out toward egypt Okay, so kambisis does a big campaign to egypt that haratidists didn't like we got to talk about haratidists Oh, there's so much okay. We'll get back to that in just a second Okay, but the sources that tom holland leans on heavily in his book Those ancient sources they don't look very fondly on kambisis. I think he was kind of an idiot Yeah, and Didn't have the nobility the noble bearing of his dad kambisis I think it's haratidus who gives us a story of kambisis taking an ill-fated ill-advised trip Out into the desert and losing a whole army out there in a sandstorm that treasure hunters still go and look for they just like got lost Yes, yeah, it's kind of lost. So all it up at the sands. They're out there somewhere. Good luck I mean if that ever gets found it's gonna be the the greatest discovery of anything ever It'd be amazing if that's actually out there and and somebody could dig up. I mean, can you imagine? 40,000 Persian troops From the five teens bc with all of their metal and all of their stuff Preserved out there in the sand. Oh, it's just to be amazing. I mean it would it would connect us to the ancient world in a way Previously unimaginable at any rate Yeah, so kambisis it went pretty ugly according to the ancient historian haratidus in egypt he Killed some nobleman's sons in front of them to make a show of things And everybody even his own people according to haratidus They didn't like what kambisis was doing He killed some bull that they worshipped in egypt was the rumor in some Crazy mad rage and so he gained this title the mad king Cambyses and then on the return trip back to babylon and susa and Persepolis There are a lot of capitals of persia He somehow cut himself on his lance or his sword And it went gangreness and he just died just but over in a couple days Yeah, they were talking about maybe on his horse or something and now you've got a succession crisis. Yeah Yeah, and now his lancebearer And six of his buddies know something the rest of the empire doesn't know the king is dead And his little brother bardia is In line To become king and that's where we pick up with the story you were referencing which is thank you that that helped a lot Yeah, so the seven conspirators they get together and like all right. Let's go kill bardia and so They head over there And they like not this is the way it the story reads to me Um They knock on the door and they're like, oh, yes, can I please speak to bardia, please? And they're like yes Come on in And they open sure and they open the door and he walks in and he's like hey are you bardies like yeah, and they're like, okay They just kill him And then they write off really quick and this is an interesting story So they write off and you got the seven conspirators and they're riding their horses And they say because they're all in persia. They're all all the the royalty or all the uh, the upper class They're really good horsemen And so they're riding over the hill and they're like all right. So we have fleet what we're gonna do Is we're gonna sit here on this hill And we're gonna look at the sunrise over that mountain And after the first light beam comes over the mountain We're gonna wait and who's ever horse? Whichever horse when he's first That's gonna be the new king And everybody's like you agree. Yeah, I agree And then it happens the sun comes up and the the light beam This is a funny story And it's hilarious to me that this is like uh lasted so long everybody's like knows what happened and so the uh, I guess content warning uh ancient history content warning uh for parents, but apparently darius the cheater stuck his fingers in the vagina of a horse and held it up to his horse at the nose And his horse smells it and was like Well, what have we here looks like i'm the king boys It's so darius is the king And they're all like yeah, that was a good one darius. Okay. Yeah, you're the king because of this little uh, horse vagina trick you just did And that blows my mind. There are so many other ways for you to say that But that's what happened Right. Yeah, that's well. I mean that that's the story. Yeah, that's the story But this is a story that's passed down and an entire empire is built upon correct Yes, right and that is so important to how the entire thing works itself out that question of How did this happen and is it legitimate? Yes, do you remember the name of the dynasty? That newly self-appointed king darius declared. What was the name of his dynasty? Oh goodness. You're asking me hard alchemy did there something is that Do that's pretty good. You said a lot of the letters that are in the answer. What is it? It's the the achaemenid Achaemenid. Thank you. Yeah And so what darius is doing there because he doesn't have a good claim to the throne He's like maybe 27 when all this went down that could be making stuff up really but he was a young man. He was the lance bearer Two kambicis the second the king when he got killed by his lance. Okay, I didn't I didn't catch that. That's a little suspicious Wow, right. Okay the normal assumption that somebody would have when there's like the title of the king of kings of all lands of all nations of earth and water at stake and a person who's in charge of the king's lance Is standing there declaring himself king right after the former king died of a wound from his own lance would be hey wait a minute Did you maybe kill the king and then come up with an elaborate plot to make yourself the king totally not So he had to get ahead of the narrative, right? Totally not. Well, the oh dude and then the narrative is nuts Well, the and the other question is Did they actually kill bardia? Like that's a question People don't know right it could have been somebody that looked like bardia. They didn't know what bardia look like It could have been or bardia could have just been like you know what? I'm gonna go be a farmer. I agree. I'll never come around again. I'm gonna go be a farmer Who knows what happened right and they didn't even mint coins with faces on them at this point That was a they didn't have language in in asia minor They didn't have language at this point darius was the one that said hey We need a language am I right about that? Like I think that's an overstatement. Okay. Thank you. No, no these were a very cosmopolitan multi-lingual people and We know for example from the books of second chronicles asra and niamaya in the bible. Yeah, there's a lot of There's a lot of court drama in those courtroom drama like will the king make it to the archives before the enemies make it there To destroy the record that will Exonerate the people and solve the crisis or will the bad guy get there first and burn it and then when the king walks in be like I couldn't find that record. I guess it's just gone In the persian era bible business, but we do get indications That these decrees that were held in the the old capital of the Medes Equatana that darius finds during his reign and that a decree that syrus issued earlier that these were issued in Aramaic an early form of the language that Was jesus of Nazareth's daily language In addition the language of the illamites and a bunch of other stuff so the persians They really wanted to be the kings of kings the kings of the world and rather than inflicting one language on everybody They very much operated in multiple languages as a concession because before them You had the Babylonians and you had the Assyrians and they were both very iron-fisted And tried to control a huge swath of the ancient world as well Just through brute raw force and fear And so when the persians came along they were like that was the undoing of both of our predecessors We should take a more conciliatory approach to governance And so this factors really heavily in the Hebrew bible and the christian bible When the jews had been taken captive by nebokaneser of the Babylonians in 586 BC about 40 years 50 years before the persians showed up and their temple got destroyed and jerusallum got destroyed and the walls were torn down And the last remaining jewish people were taken away probably to be lost forever to history just sort of Bread into whatever the Babylonians would be and that you'd never even hear about the jews, but instead The Old Testament credits god as supernaturally ordaining that syrus would be raised up And that he wouldn't just defeat and punish the Babylonians But that syrus would also let the jews return to rebuild jerusallum and the temple and indeed that i mean that's all over the bible syrus the great Surely ranks in the top 100 Most mentioned people in the entire bible. He's a very very prominent figure In the bible, which is interesting and that's that's what this did for me. It's it made things come alive It was a good book man. It was written well It just made that ancient world Real to me It framed it in terms of current events like right now uh As we record this we're we're kind of in the middle of a large invasion of the ukraine by russia hmm and i see a lot of parallels to how this is going on because the greeks So let's okay, so you've got i guess we need to we need to finish out the persians, right? Let me do a quick grand reset so you can make that point we can all be operating from the same Well, we gotta get from the dearest desert seas real quick like just mention zerxes. We'll do that Yeah, take us there. How do we do it? How do we get from Why are we in a fight with the greeks? Well, okay, so syrus basically got everything ready for war and then Can't buy a season party at That thing happened and then darius is like, okay I guess it's time for war because i got this army sitting here And i can war people so i'm gonna do it I'm sorry. I can't let it go man. No, no, no, that's that's not really what happened. Okay. Tell me syrus set his sites on asia miner And that's plenty for now. Okay, he had designs on working into what historically would be The the homeland of the historic ukranian people. Okay, the sythians Now the sythians didn't they don't live they didn't live in the exact borders of modern ukraine But syrus couldn't handle the sythians nobody could handle the sythians The sythians are not a good people to invade. They're of a weird stock. They don't meet you in battle they stay on the move and Persia never got them so history says Maybe not the best idea to try to tackle ukraine Or this people group for long periods of time the combination of who they are and where they live Makes them very difficult to defeat and then keep pinned down. I think it's an interesting historical footnote but syris then feeling like he has to put down a couple of rebellions in lydia with the the western most outpost of his empire being in the City near effeces so clear out toward greece but still in modern day turkey Called sardis and that was his big outpost in the far west and they rebelled a couple times and syris was mean over those rebellions And but he got it on lockdown and he built or rather secured a highway that ran all the way from sardis all the way back across through babylon and susa and pasa garde and Persepolis and also looped up to ekpatana all the big cities of the empire were now connected all the way east to west it was an amazing achievement of unifying through diplomacy and violent diplomacy there's also seeing as violent diplomacy force and so for syris he didn't have designs on the greek mainland he had culturally greek holdings in asia miner but he wasn't even looking at Athens or sparta i'm not sure he even knew anything about who Athens or sparta were wasn't on his radar he had his site set north into modern day russia and ukraine and his site set east and at some point he wanted to get around to egypt but egypt's of it's a tough tough foe historically when kambisis took over it looks like he wanted to take the big Obvious thing that was missing from this global empire We can't really call ourselves the king of kings if there's an independent pharaoh ruling on the Nile and so kambisis went that direction and that's really all he ever accomplished i mean he rained for a decent chunk of time but that's what he got done still Athens and sparta they're not really on the map very much other than somewhere during the reign of syris they started needling just a little bit at some of those greek speaking city states and needle that they're loyalty they meddled they goofed around and tried to sow discord there between these greeks in asia miner modern day turkey and their new persian overlords from way out east it didn't amount to much for a long time but after darius became king it quickly began to amount to a lot and it started to feel like another full blown rebellion from those danged greeks and asia miner way out there at the edge of our territory and so darius became agitated and found out that the instigators were these stupid atheanians and some of their allies as well and that's when we really start to see things escalate well one of the things the persians would do is they would say okay we have a freaking huge army and so they would go to these different people groups and they would say hey we demand earth and water what does that mean give us some earth give us some of your water meaning it like symbolically give us a shovel full of dirt or something in a pitcher of water to demonstrate that your land is basically under our protection um yeah and that you will pay tribute to the king the king of kings in this case the king of persia a lot of people chose the pacifist approach they would say cool whatever um we don't even know who you are we don't care here's a jar of water whatever later so not even pacifist but just passive yeah then they get to uh that that almost sounds like the uh who was it that said that the british guy uh that said you know he read this agreement from hitler uh in the 30s famously he says we we have an agreement and we he reads it in front of people basically like oh we've got an agreement and then later on hitler comes knocking you mean churchills predecessor neville chamberland yes yeah was it chamberland yes thank you i don't know yeah i think it is but anyway it's it's interesting and and he's just basically saying just acknowledge that i'm all more awesome than you and they're like no the creeks well some of the greeks didn't really care and they said maybe we should just do it and the spartans were like nah we're not gonna do that so let's get to zirksies real quick so it goes like this it goes syrus can buy season bardia then it goes darius the cheater and then after darius dies it's zirksies yes very very good yeah i bet you can even extend forward past the book you read and guess who zirksies successor was just based on his name uh heard of him was it it was it zirksies the second i don't know zirksies the second did exist but he rained only very briefly from four twenty five to four twenty four but in between zirksies the first and zirksies the second was art as xirksies art xirksies super super super famous important king yeah so timeline goes like this five fifty ish somewhere in there syrus boxes out his rivals uh the meads and others and begins his conquest of babylon syrus is king in one way or another from five fifty ish to five twenty nine from five twenty nine to five twenty two is camp biceys and bardia with only being if he ever even was king only very very briefly then darius is an absolute rock star five twenty two to four eighty six is darius forty six to four sixty five is zirksies does that help with timeline did you do that from your head or did you google that i did not google that that's a no that's impressive very impressive hey this episode of notum questions is brought to you by raycon they make super awesome earbuds that we both use and that we both give his gifts and that i carry around every day in my pocket because there's just always some need for my raycans at all times and we're grateful that they have been a friend of the program for a very long time deston what do you like about raycans i like the fact that the knowledge that i gained in this episode came into my brain via raycans not all of it i mean there were sometimes i was listening to the track and whatnot but like when i was mowing or using a tractor at one point i had the raycans in and i was listening to uh tom holland's Persian fire and it was awesome like there are specific things i can remember doing on the lawn mower i'm like oh i was at this location in the yard when i first learned about whatever it's interesting because now i have a mental map of the Persian empire that i gained while i was in your yard yeah exactly it's mapped out i've never thought about that but so much of my persia knowledge came into my brain via raycans too because i went on this big kick maybe six eight months ago where i would finish up my responsibilities for the day and then i would go fish and i would just queue up books and lectures about persia primary sources and when i picture persia knowledge i picture my white raycans and brook trout on one particular trail where i fished and fished and fished and just listened to things about persia that's the one where i put my hand on that rattlesnake oh yeah that one that's fun man here's the offer if you want to break on wait wait wait what do you know why i didn't get bit by the rattlesnake destined why matt do you know why i was aware of the rattlesnake was an awareness mode was awareness mode because i had on the awareness mode tell me vermatically is how how did you hear the rattlesnake well since hit the fourth i had chosen to be an awareness map because of the possibility that i might encounter rattlesnake given the harsh and fire-arms and which are fishing i had awareness mode activated and sure enough well i was scaling the front of a cliff to get to a whole lot of particular inviting i heard a little i was like dang i should not go any further and then i saw snake and it did not bite me and then i sent you a picture of that snake that's awesome yeah there's sound profiles you can use as well well you can navigate between the sound profiles you hold the left earbud for three seconds and it'll just toggle between them you got the pure sound

you so much for supporting the sponsors when you do that supports the podcast and we are grateful i guess the next thing that would make sense is you've got the Greeks over here and to your left and you've got the Persians to your right and they're going to war right and i think we should start with the way it first started which was the battle of marathon well it's not quite how it first started marathon's the famous one but there's one big battle that i think holland covers in his version of the story called the battle of latte yes he did battle of latte is in 594 and it happens near the city of myelitis which is a disputed city on the west coast of asia miner and athens has been messing with them trying to provoke rebellion and darius only kind of takes it seriously ultimately it is a narrow victory for darius but enough of a costly pain in the butt that darius is like remind me to punish those atheanians we need to do something about that and that is the incident that really pushes us toward well the road to marathon which you're talking about now i don't completely understand the battle of marathon i do know that the uh the way it went down the Persians showed up the original Greeks that make contact were like whoa what's up and they uh they sent a runner what was the runner's name jaga cliz jaga fast runner cliz i don't remember naki cliz uh no i i forget is like uripides or something like that but this guy uh he ran and he ran to go get help and when he showed up with sparta right am i remembering this correctly he would have run to athens i would think forgive me i forget where he ran so some of the greeks sent a runner to some of the other greeks and when they showed up they were like having a party like so they're like what's going on and uh they had their tents set up as if they were you know campaigning you know but it was actually just a festival and they're like hey there's war happening and they're like what and uh long story short the greeks won against an overwhelming force that was a really really big deal and they rested on those laurels for many many years and there were some very interesting people that were generals at that battle did they call them stratigos what did they call them stratagoy what they call the generals uh that sounds correct right there the generals on the Persians side were very very prominent we know a lot about them a guy named daddis and a guy named arta fernies arta fernies factors super super heavily because of his relationship with the royal family he's just all over these battles and all over this strategy and they were good theoretically that should have been enough mental power to absolutely whip the greeks but the battle it's a mess like there was there was chaos on both sides of the line according to the ancient historian her heradidas who we need to talk more about and you know what why am i even talking about i literally have at my desk because i'm working on purges stuff all the time my desk is a mountain of purges stuff right now i literally have heradidas this is what it sounds like it's that many pages mmm still going there's still more pages keep listening and that's in english well i don't think it was in the first place but somebody did some work and made it more English and i have it sitting open i have it sitting open right now to book three that's what i was last reading in heradidas check this out here's the page it was open to you're gonna get a kick out of this now darius had a clever groom whose name was oobberies to this man when they had left their assembly darius spoke oobberies we resolved to do about the kingdom thus namely that the man whose horse first nays at sunrise when we are mounted upon our horses he shall be king now therefore if you have any cleverness contrived that that we may obtain this prize and not any other man oobberies replied thus if my master it depends in truth upon this whether you be king or no have confidence so far as concerns this and keep a good heart for none others shall be king before you such charms have i at my command that's how heradidas tells the story that you were summarizing of how darius won the horse contest to be king that's good right that's good yeah then darius said if then you have any such trick it is time to devise it and not put things off for our trial is tomorrow oh oobberies therefore hearing this did as follows when night was coming on he took one of the mares namely that one which the horse of darius preferred and this he led into a suburb of the city and tied her up then he brought to her the horse of darius and having for some time led them round her making them go close so as to touch the mare at least he let the horse mount now at dawn the six came to the place as they had agreed riding upon their horses and as they rode through the suburb of the city when they came near the place where the mare had nayed just when the horse had done this there came lightning and thunder from a clear sky and these things consummated darius's claim for they seem to have come to pass by some design and the others leapt down from their horses and did obeceance to darius wow and then in the next line um hiratidis tells us about another version a juicier version of the story that uh that some others knew so this is important i'm actually going to read this i mean because it's a funny story but also because it tells you a little bit about how the sources on this stuff works when we go back for this far in time so hiratidis goes on when did hiratidis write this uh hiratidis of hally karnassus was a contemporary of xerxes and wrote a little while say 480's he would have been a contemporary of xerxes and art as xerxes so mid 400's okay i'd say okay i mean it's probably on the book got it uh well yeah so the campaign was in 480's so it'd be yeah it'd be after that so the mid okay i'm with you keep going go for it yeah okay so hiratidis though at times like he traveled all around the world he went to egypt he's from he's greek he he knows people in these stories he gets conflicting stories and when he does he just gives you both stories so he goes on to say now some say that the contrivance of oibre's was this but others say as follows for the purgians tell the story in both ways namely that he touched with his hands the parts of the mare and kept his hand hidden in his trousers and when it sunrise they were about to let the horses go this oibre's pulled out his hand and applied it to the nostrils of the horse of darius and the horse perceiving the smell snorted and nade and thus darius was named king aha it's good storytelling right dinkhand for i am the king indeed not so much my hand that is gross but this gentleman here what uh like yeah we're people and we're going to that is very different than george washington crossing the delaware to fight the hessians i'm just going to say those are very different things matt is it yes we got to talk more about that we got to talk more i mean the hessians i'm driving at okay go ahead with this hiratidis thing it was the reason i i i i grabbed this book and dude you we're just not going to need me anymore where did you just it's like you sit around and pound history when we don't hang out together i i understand what this means the gauntlet is thrown down thrown down i i've worked to do you have to make a rocket now i have to make a rocket i must make all you will simply be replaced and i have ideas for how we shall choose your successor and it bobs stinkhand so we get this uh we get this hiratidis guy right and he's called the father of history by some but also some from the ancient world called him the father of lies yeah because that's not what happened there was no stinkhand i mean these stories they're in color they're in full relief the characters have motivations and they give these big stirring speeches and hiratidis is very interested in symmetry to the stories so somebody does a bad thing there's going to be a reversal and you're going to get that back now that's interesting to me because of the bible in the same era all of the parts of the bible that are contemporary with hiratidis are also very interested in symmetry right down to the details of the Babylonian kings who looted the temple of god in jerusalem they're having a banquet one night in the book of daniel in this era the last night of babylon ever the banquet on the last night of the empire and they they all get drunk and the regent kings like bring out all the fancy dishes from the jews temple let's make a mockery of their god and then famously the story goes that a hand appears and there's writing on the wall that's where we get the phrase the writing on the wall and daniel the minay minay tick a epperson yeah nice job man you've been weighed and found wanting and this very night your kingdom will be divided between the meads and the Persians and then the next verses like and then that happened you read about that and then you see that one of the very next things that syrus did according to the bible i mean right away when he became king he let the jews go back and according to the book of esra he took all those dishes that got used to mock the god of the jews and he gave him back to him and esra gives a careful detailed accounting of each and every dish and fork that was given back why is he given the details because it's that theme of reversal these leaders they get bloated they get fat they get drunk they don't care about the truth of the it's hubris and in the bible god smacks that down and uh upholds the humble in harada this it's a little different set of values it's a greekish set of values but we see that that story really played with his audience at that moment in time people were tired of these mega powers being drunk on their authority and abusing their authority particularly the asyrians and then the babylonians after that so when you read harada this what you're reading is history but it is very animated history and as a result like this book by tom holland like like he ascribes motives to people he yes yeah i i mean i and i think this is the type of writing that teaches me i i read a book recently about the the battle of gettiesburg and the way it was written it kind of put me there mentally and now that i've been there i understand it more and i understand where the the pieces fit and i care yeah i think that's what's so interesting like i will never have a command of history like you do it's it's impressive you you know i i can go to one battlefield and i can i can mentally place myself on that battlefield and be like oh yeah and then this happened and then you know i can i can be in that one place but what i don't have what you do have is the ability to see where that one piece of the jigsaw puzzle and how that plays into the overall picture i envy your ability to do that it's incredible and so that's why these conversations are so valuable to me because they helped me understand you know all i'm doing here is i'm regurgitating some words and names and places that i heard and i'm trying to piece them together like a child but you're doing a really good job of helping me know why and so i just want to say that over the last however many years we've been friends you've made me care about history because of how interested you are in it genuinely like mics on mics off you genuinely care and you and you see how that plays into everything and uh yeah it's uh it's rubbing off on me man i really i really enjoy it and never in my life did i look at every single little physical thing in the world and think about how that works until your interest and mics on mics off passion for that stuff rubbed off on me so i'm really it's really kind of you to suggest that the stuff i'm interested in in anyway positively affected how you think about the world and where we came from but thank you for saying that you're welcome i had a scary thought in the middle of this book it it came like a shadow is like someone walking by in a shadow just kind of like and you feel it and then it goes it goes away and and the thought was you know if you learned greek deston you could you could just read this stuff and i thought what was that what was that it it it reminded me uh cs luice was talking at one point in a book and he said something about you know the the amount of effort it takes for a man to finally settle down and learn greek and i was like who would learn greek why would you ever do that and then i felt the shadow i'm like what what it was what was that interesting it's amazing okay so that was a fun rabbit trail but uh it was a fun rabbit trail let me draw the lines here so we've got all right so i'm just gonna say it again we got syrus we have ken by season bardia darius may or may not have killed both of them or something happened there for sure we've got the stink hand in 22 to 46 we've got the stink hand incidence and uh now darius is king and then after that it's unfortunate that people are going to learn it that way as opposed to the british uh voice actor whom i learned it from that read it was said that darius on upon the dawn of the light and then and i just said yeah i apologize everybody in the third chair that this is the way you've learned this information i'm so sorry i don't uh okay and then after darius we have zirksies and okay so that's over there on the persian side on the greek side we've got all these different city states doing their things we had the battle of marathon and the battle of marathon the thing that's amazing is after the battlefield false silent and the greeks routed the uh the persians on the the greek side and in a much tinier force you have a total of like 192 men dead on the persian side you got something like six thousand that is not symmetric in terms of casualties so the greeks are are serious about the fight the persians are not like they're there because they got drug there by their leader their greeks are like this is home we're fighting and so that's when that's when i started seeing the similarities in some of the battles that i'm seeing today the types of weapons that were used mattered you know the persians tended to have wicked shields very good whereas the greeks had you know the hoplite you've got these people that are trained in battle uh at the battle of marathon they were the Athenians they were not the spartan so did they have hoplites then absolutely yeah that's that's the basic uh heavy infantry unit medium infantry unit maybe you could call it of the greeks and the persians were built to whip everything else but they weren't built to whip that that matters so much i think one thing that's interesting is the way they fought it's just incredible the greeks fought as one and you were a small component in a larger machine when you fought and you had to do certain things that the persians seemed to rely on archer's quite a bit which the shields of the greeks seemed to neutralize anyway so that's the battle of marathon nothing happens for what is it 12 14 years i forget the number it's a long time uh eight to ten depending on how you date it okay um yes and i'm trying to decide when i'm going to push back on your narrative and i think i would like to do it now do it so here's something i need to disclose i'm sort of team Persia what i yeah i had a feeling that wouldn't go over well how are you team Persia uh Babylon i'm not sure i go ahead they made Babylon out of mud like Babylon is like Sin City it's Las Vegas of the old world and it's like they how are you team Persia i'm team Persia for a few reasons one i don't buy Herodotus's account but i do but i don't he's not holding himself out as a modern historian he's not doing this cold sterile safe version of history where he gets into the minutiae of these boring little details and restrains from any speculation about motivation that's how we do history now he's telling a story the kind of story that we get people to gather around and listen the kind of story that gets you paid like the ileana story that motivates people i sort of yeah those are different genres but they're close cousins stylistically i mean the ilead is it's poetry and Herodotus is definitely not organized poetically it is narrative but nobody had done this this way before him i don't have any gripes with Herodotus you but you just have to read him for what he is to it he is not the most ludicrous storyteller of his era there's another guy named Xenophon who takes crazy logical leaps in his storytelling but Herodotus is trying to make a point and i've read through the histories which again has a lot of pages and this is what you start to recognize Herodotus respects the common man who isn't soft who isn't drunk on power who you'll hear a lot of historians use this characterization who isn't wearing silk slippers and Herodotus's account of Persia is one that demonstrates a lot of respect for Cyrus he likes Cyrus he has a problem with the enemies of Cyrus Herodotus seems to be happy that Cyrus beat the Babylonians they've gotten soft the Babylonians they worked their butts off back in the 600s to knock off evil Assyria but they went up the steps in hard working shoes wood shoes but then they descended them in silk slippers and he thinks Cyrus was a working man a man of the people a man of character and vision he has relatively high regard for Darius sometimes he certainly respects the administrative acumen of Darius and Xerxes but by the time Xerxes comes around Herodotus he thinks the Persians have gone soft he thinks that Xerxes is a little too effeminate a little bit too into fancy frilly things that he's too obsessed with himself that his retinue is too expensive when he travels and he makes sure to point out the most ridiculous excesses of these kings the further along we get into Persian history is some of it true probably is all of it true no it looks like it's a characterization to make the story work well I mean and history is written by the victors and Herodotus is Greek well that's the funny thing about Herodotus though he's from halicarnassus you know who else is from halicarnassus? Artemisia the woman general the woman admiral yeah who is at all of these big battles and is a trusted advisor at Salamis of a king yes Salamis she's a trusted advisor of Xerxes that's where Herodotus is from she's of the same stock as Herodotus so he's really a guy who has his feet in both worlds and he reads like somebody who wanted the Persia thing to work out he maybe even kind of liked the initial vision and he unapologetically views the Greeks as rascals he's not happy with how his own people handle their business either their politics are dirty they've got some silly sensibilities they make some stupid moves but when push came to shove he liked the style of the Greeks better than he liked the style of the bloated overly soft extravagant Persian empire as it had become in his mind by the time Xerxes comes around so everything we get from Herodotus is upholding that characterization I just gave you but everything I get from non-Greek sources which isn't as much because most of what we know about Persia we know from Greeks what we get from the non-Greek sources these Persian kings looking pretty amazing and if you just look at what they accomplished syrus darius Xerxes artaxerxes they were phenomenal there's one more power broker too and artaxerxes the second who comes along in the very late 400s and rules for almost 50 years he was a great administrator the Persians they rolled double sixes like five times in a row on their kings that never happens in history and so I for one look at this and I go these were the first people to disrupt this violent awful enslaving cycle that had existed in all the mega empires prior and I think the Persians are as much as anyone deserving of credit as the foundational people of the west for all of my upbringing I was taught that the west or the Greeks and that the east were the Persians I think it's a battle between westerners and another kind of westerners and the Greek version of western thought is the one that won out so I like Persia and I read this a little bit differently than tom holland but he's smarter than me and I still love this book interesting interesting the main yeah are we still friends yeah I mean yeah you're the authority I'm not but I did enjoy being introduced to the ancient religion of the Persians zoa astrian what was that how do you say that very good yeah very good who's their whose their main god do you remember that a hoora Mazda nice job man look at you you're just a sponge yeah i meant it when I was listening to it I really wanted to know and fire was huge in their in their culture and is a purifying tool I mean there's just a lot to that so that was really interesting to learn about I feel like man this is a this is a well that's so deep you've been studying it for months we may have to we may have to break this up because there's too much here i'm game we've got the Persian leaders okay the battle of marathon there was there was one yes one person at the battle of marathon that I loved and I thought this person was awesome and I kind of want to be like this person well let's put this way I want this person's reputation and that was what was his name eristides the just I just had to look that up eristides the just the just yeah that's pretty good name isn't it yeah and it was said like they gathered up all the loot in the spoil from the battle after marathon and they're like all right we're gonna leave all this what do we do I mean we can't just leave it here somebody else still I know give it to eristides because he's the most honest person in our entire culture and they're like what oh wait yeah eristides yeah totally yeah let him watch it I was like that is the kind of reputation I want I want the kind of reputation where people were like oh well if he's saying it then yeah of course he's telling the truth I mean your name is worth more than gold and eristides did it what's interesting is after the battle of marathon they go back to Athens eristides and what's his name thermistically yes so these are the two dudes right and thermistically is like the the first guy who campaigns like a modern politician in a democracy he's like hey vote for me you know he hang yeah he hangs out for my idea yeah at a platform what was his platform if you vote for me we will do what he wanted a navy and he wanted a harbor yeah he wanted a he wanted a new harbor yes and that was crazy and at the time the and this is amazing to me at the time the the boat the type of boat that was fashionable was called a tri-reem and basically basically you had three imagine you get in a boat and you're you know like Ben Hurstile like you're rowing the oars right well if you're smart you can stack in more oars by going vertical with them so you have three rows of oars and you can row with them and the Phoenicians were like the bosses at this but the you know the Persians were really really good and the Athenians were like I don't know I've seen boats before I don't really know how they work but you know they seem cool and all and thermistically he's was like yo dog we need boats and the way he sold it to everybody he's like let's build a harbor down at this new place and it'll let us do this and let us do this and this and this and this and oh by the way we might make a little naval port but anyway but yeah the trade is going to be amazing and so he totally sold everybody on the harbor ultimately he gets his boats these boats ended up being a huge deal in the upcoming battle here's they were everything everything yeah everything and so when Xerxes shows up famously whips the water what was that about tell me about that that was about crossing the helispont that that little bit of water there is you're coming across from Asia Minor into the European the greek mainland there he built a pontoon boat so like opposite the boss for us uh yes and he uh the story goes who knows if this is true or more of Herodotus characterizing Xerxes as an unstable goofball I mean surely Zack Snyder latched on to Herodotus as characterization of Xerxes in 300 what we do see is all these kings are upholding a narrative Darius is upholding a narrative that he is the guy who defeated the lie people were trying to steal the kingdom the lie and yes we're a Mazda ordained him there was somebody Darius asserted that somebody was trying to impersonate Bardia and that the true Bardia was already dead assassinated but that this shapeshifter magician had taken over the spot and he didn't even kill Bardia he killed a magical imposter of Bardia to keep the kingdom from being stolen ah he actually was doing a favor to everyone I see and so you know Darius builds in to the DNA of of these kings that they are the upholders of the truth and they will snuff out the lie that just happens to totally undermine their claim to the throne and so this idea that nature had chosen them was very important that a Huramazda had chosen them was very important so maybe Xerxes did have the waves whipped as a punishment for their rebellion against the will of a Huramazda who clearly wanted Xerxes in his army to cross the Hellespont and punish the Greeks who were also in opposition to a Huramazda and the will of the true god end of nature so it maybe it happened I don't meanwhile over in Greece just a few years before Aristides and the mystocles who were generals at Marathon they were politically opposed to each other and the mystocles won god is navy and Aristides had to leave who's the Greek that is a advising Xerxes who was that there was a Greek that ended up um it starts with an a and I knew this once okay I'm looking at it this time is kleisthanes and obviously anitis but it was a former Spartan I don't remember there's not art of fernes is it no art of fernes is Persian okay no I don't know so anyway yeah we'll think of it later there's a there's a Greek person uh with Xerxes telling him what's going on and so he starts slowly marching over to Greece basically the Greeks come up with this plan they're like okay so he could land here he could land here we could do this this or this and so part of the plan and this is where it's kind of you know they had a council of war and they're like all right what are we gonna do they create an alliance of all these city states that hate each other like all right we got to do something um the mystically as you guys came up with this navy demeritus sorry found it in Herodotus demeritus demerit yeah I remember thinking the name demeritus yeah like demerits yeah that's it yes and so domestically has the navy the Spartans have their kings and they do some kind of religious thing and then they say okay this uh this virgin lady that's a prophet kind of person she says oh well yes you got two options Athens is gonna burn or something who is this lady again she's some kind of magic woman oh dude I mean we all just got to do this twice we really do because we're not even halfway through this story and and we're not even to the juicy bits why don't we stop talking about the oracle at delphi yes and the oracle at delphi dude let me just tease it let me just tease it Sparta wasn't going to war yeah this would be the place to stop so I told you that Xerxes is marching under the banner of a Huramazda who enabled his dad to kill the imposter and preserve the true line of kings the true ruling family the achaemenid dynasty descended from the grandfather of Cyrus the Great Xerxes is he is snuffing out the lie man that's what kings of Persia do and nature and the god of all nature a Huramazda is on his side as he marches into the greek mainland to punish these insurgents now understand at this point I am now on team Greece when it comes to this I just really happen to like Persia because there's invasion and it would have been yeah now it's an invasion and I happen I of course I'm rooting for Greece at this point but I like Cyrus a lot in particular so I have my affections for Persia as well but at the same time that Xerxes is doing all of this theater and it's dramatic stuff to communicate to all of his legions that we will win because god has willed it and ordained it well so the gods of the greeks are also in play and the way you talk to the gods of the greeks is at delphi there's this high mountain I've been there and there's this temple complex there's still a little bit of it there I've been there too and there was an oracle there there were certain prophecies there and these these prophetesses were probably high on certain fumes that emanated from a couple of caves or like yellowstone kind of geothermal stuff that happened there and when they would get into this this trance state they would almost act like the joker in the old 1960s batman stuff where they would or the joker knows a riddler they would give these clever riddles to be which almost the the different greek city states because the the oracle delphi it wasn't on the side of one greek city state or another they all had access to it and it's almost like the enjoyed playing them off of each other so it wasn't like go march into battle against Xerxes and if you meet him at this bay you will surely have victory no make sure to deploy your archers to the right i mean it wasn't like that it was a riddle crazy riddles yeah and they couldn't agree on how to read it they didn't know how to interpret the riddle and so the spartan army just ground to a halt one of the things they said was uh you may have to mourn the loss of a king i don't know that we can say much more for an for an a break this into two pieces we've set the stage for battle right right i think well i think you've done a marvelous job of that and it's not what i find so interesting is it's a battle of narrative not just soldiers honestly pound for pound on the battlefield we already know that the hoplite is superior in a matchup against what the Persians are bringing to the forefront now this time around Xerxes is coming with something different he's bringing his global cosmopolitan army that is just whatever your people group your subject people group is good at dress up how you dress and bring the weapon you use and we're going to make a statement that all of earth is going against you and your homogenous army of hoplites we are earth you are one people there's a group of warriors called the immortals and they're going to bring them to bear at a very specific battle that we should not say the name of right now yeah it's pretty good isn't it it really is do it's so good even if it's a long time before we get back to this and i'd be up for coming right back to it immediately we'll figure that out later i suppose but even if it's a long time what i love about this story are the big colorful characters i love the way it overlaps with stuff that that i care a lot about that involves the bible both the old testament and the new testament this stuff we're talking about at delphi it's the the spirit of python is what informs these these prophets well the spirit of python comes into play in the book of acts when paul goes to one of the cities right up by delphi and there's a young girl there much like these delphi oracles who can give prophecies and according to the story and acts the demon the spirit gets cast out of her and her slave owner is irate because now she can't prophesy anymore because she lost the spirit of the python defeated by apollo all the way back in the day when he was at delphi i mean it all it all fits together and adds such depth and color to so many stories that matter so much artistically narratively religiously politically legally to our shared story that we have and so it's not just looking back in time and picking one little interesting nugget me like oh look they're all interesting people that's great but the implications for this just spider web into the lives of literally every single person in the third chair right now there is stuff from this story that dramatically affects your life even to this day and to see it portrayed by these ancient sources in such a dramatic fashion it's like they knew the stakes they knew this was a fault line through all of human history and heritage and they knew it deserved epic storytelling and i'm really happy that that epic storytelling caught your attention and kept you in absolutely and and there's galley i want to keep going but we got to stop this time put kids in bed but um dude it's amazing probably one of the most interesting things to me obviously is the battle that we're about to describe in the in the next episode can we do the next episode can we just do that i'd love it let's do it we've never done a two-parter back-to-back before let's do something new i'm in the mood okay let's do that okay but here's here are my terms yeah we don't go prepare what do you mean let's get right back on mike's as soon as possible and i don't want to cheat because then the two episodes will feel totally different one would just have any conversation with whatever we remember is whatever we remember and then the second one would be all googled up you know now that you say it i was thinking about going stinkhand on you but i think i'm going to go eristidees the just yeah you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0,
