Was that difficult or was it easy back then? I didn't understand the importance of the brand. I just did not understand it. I knew I needed to call my thing a thing and I knew it needed to have certain properties. My dad made me take a marketing class in college and I didn't understand at the time, but now I do why he would have me do that. So that brand, Smarter Every Day, is probably the most valuable thing I have, so to speak. And it's a brand that can outlive me, but I didn't understand what I was doing at the time. I just didn't get it. What were your thoughts when you made the 10 minute Bible hour? Oh, I thought it would be a little thing that I did for people at church and maybe a few people outside of that. And so I did an inside baseball old timey Christian radio riff joke that slays with about one tenth of one percent of the population. And then people started watching it and I was already married to the brand and it kind of works. But it was a process I didn't think through carefully enough. Yeah. So I think a brand is hard, especially like when we built No Dumb Questions, like we talked for a long, long time about what the name should be and what we were going for and all that stuff. Months. Yeah. On the front end before we recorded or did anything. Yeah. Months we spent. I'm really happy where we landed with No Dumb Questions. The other one we tried, we tried to do the history nugget thing where we were going to make a YouTube channel with history stuff and that one failed. Yeah. Yeah. And then we did film stuff, good stuff that would still be cool to put on the internet. It just doesn't have anywhere to live. Yeah. The point is it's hard and we put a lot of thought into that one on the front end too. We spent money and we flew places and film things. Oh, I spent a lot of money. Yeah. Yeah. And so building a brand is a thing that a lot of people casually think about, but few people go all the way down the rabbit hole and like, hey, I'm doing it. I'm moving from thinking to doing. And that's what we're going to talk about today. Yeah. And brand is a complex idea. It sounds as simple as a piece of metal you would heat up and then stick into the butt of a cow so that cattle wrestlers won't be able to steal your cow and make it unidentifiable. I think that's where the term comes from. Oh, wow. I didn't think about that. Yeah, that is what it is. That's all it is. A brand is something that differentiates a bunch of things that are almost identical from each other. Interesting. So when we brand or think about branding, what we're doing is creating a story, a story that connects with a certain kind of person that resonates with a certain list of ambitions and dreams and goals and passions and insecurities. All of that gets wadded together into this very complex story that you then need to articulate very succinctly that you need to articulate in feelings and colors and quick hits. It's brutally, brutally hard to distill something complex down into something as simple as an effective brand packed with meaning that differentiates your thing in a space from a whole bunch of other similar things in a space. What does it look like to have an idea and start from absolute scratch in a world that is more crowded with branding every single day and try to navigate that process of making that unique story, that unique thing. I guess that's what we're going to talk about today, right? Yeah. So we've got this friend named Brad and Brad is making a thing. It's called Musk Ox like the animal. What's interesting is Brad, he works for the company that helps us with online advertising and stuff like that. Some of the companies that we know and love like Raycon and Away and HelloFresh. Some of these people that have advertised on Nodeum questions, here's the interesting thing. Brad approaches us and says, hey, we're working on this thing. It's called Musk Ox and we're interested to see what your thoughts are on it. And the conversation wasn't like, hey, will you advertise my thing? The conversation was we're doing this thing. What do you think? It's kind of like, hey, I want to bounce this off of you kind of stuff. I asked Brad, I asked you first and you said enthusiastically, yes. If we could talk to Brad and kind of pick his brain to try to understand where he's at in the process of making a brand. There's no money changing hands here. This is genuinely- No, no kickback. Nothing. We have sponsors. Look, let's just pull back the curtain. We have patrons. We have sponsors who we like and who've been with us for a really long time. We love working with them. But more so, we have patrons and what the patrons invest in, what the winged has SARS make happen with the program is the content is third chair driven. We don't have some kind of sweetheart deal here in any way with this thing. It's just a world that we both think about a lot. We know what it's like to try to build a brand and realize, uh-oh, we got a pivot that needs to look like this. It made sense on paper at Chili's. It doesn't make sense here. And I thought it would be fun as you thought it would be fun to completely pull back the curtain on that. I know Brad fairly well. I want to be ruthless. I want to get into the hyper honest realm here with him. He's a strong dude. I think that's where the value is. He can take it. He's a strong guy. Let's go hear from a sponsor that's supporting this episode and then we'll go jump on with Brad, who is not? Perfect. This episode of Notum Questions is sponsored by Away. Away makes awesome travel luggage that is just incredible to use. This stuff is rugged. It's well built. I love it. I started using Away because they had this little battery built in if you choose that option, but I continue to use Away because I like the way it works. I like the way I can cinch down on it and zip all my stuff up and it's been rugged. I mean, every Away bag that I have, I have multiple now, they continue to work years after I've acquired them. I love these things. We had the red luggage as kids from the 1960s that turns pink with age. Do you remember these? No. The long silver latches on the top. You don't see them hardly ever anymore, but every now and then I'll still see one on a baggage carousel. But that's what we had for the longest time. And it was awful packing and operating out of those as kids on a trip was a nightmare. Nothing ever stayed where it was supposed to go. Nothing about it was intuitive or did the obvious things you would need luggage to do? When I got my first Away bag, everything changed. I have landed on this product and will stay on this product because everything is exactly where it's supposed to be and all the things I would want the bag to do. It does, including the power thing, but the way it cinches down, the way it zips up, the way it rolls. I'd had cheapo roller bags in the past too, but they're miserable. They don't move through the airport the way you want. They're not engineered well. Away is gold. It is so silky to maneuver it the way you need to maneuver it in a crowd. Yeah. One of my favorite things is everybody's about to start flying again, hopefully. And yay. So the thing that the engineers at Away did clearly is they said, what is the maximum volume that's allowable? And that's the size of our bag. So it fits in the travel on, whatever you call it, the carry on bag volumetric limits and it's perfect. And not only that, but it has four casters on bottom. So it rolls really well. When I'm sitting in line at the airport, I'll just sit there and spin the thing around just because it's fun because the bearings are so good. Anyway, if you want to try this, you can get a 100 day trial by going to awaytravel.com slash in DQ. Again, that's away travel.com slash in DQ by a bag. You get a 100 day trial. You don't like it. Give it back. It's that easy. That's how sure they are that you're going to love it. It's still going to be in good shape after 100 days, no matter how much you travel. Have you ever been at the window at your gate and you see the luggage being loaded up? Yeah. The people that are just throwing it on the conveyor belt kind of thing. Yeah, I saw that. I saw my sand colored Away bag get taken off the cart and just whipped heaved onto that belt and it bounced around and tumbled. And I thought, yeah, do your worst. You cannot destroy this thing. It didn't bother me at all. No, it's really good stuff. Can't break it. It's the right toughness, which means it's pliable enough to bend, but it won't break. So they've nailed the sweet spot on the Ashby plot if you're a mechanical engineer. It's fantastic. So that's it. 100 day trial, you're going to love it. You will not send it back, but you have the option if you want it. So again, that's away travel.com slash in DQ. One more time away travel.com slash on DQ. When you support the sponsors, you support this podcast and we are grateful. Thank you very much. Yep. We appreciate you. All right. This is our buddy Brad and Brad has been working on this thing called musk ox and it's really interesting. But before we get started here, Brad, I just want to make sure that this is clear. You are not paying us in any way to have this conversation. Is that a true statement or a false statement? That is indeed a true statement. Okay. And at one point you said, Hey, you are interested in working with note on questions and Matt and I, we said, Hey, we're more interested in what you're doing. We love the fact that we get sponsorship from out loud and we have appreciated what we've seen so far from what you've made. So we didn't want to come back and be like, No, we reject your products and reject what you're doing. We just felt we could provide more value to ourselves and to the third chair, the audience by having a conversation that isn't sponsored, which changes the nature of the conversation about what it is to start something, what you go through, what kind of stuff you wrestle with, what happens when it's already launched and you're trying to figure out how to tweak it the right way. We figured if we took your money, well, then it has to be a commercial and this way it doesn't have to be a commercial. You're doing something very different than what you normally do. Is that right, Brad? That's right. So we had this hairbrained idea to launch a men's outdoor clothing apparel brand, Muscox. There's plenty of challenges along the way, but at the end of the day, it's something that we're really excited about for a lot of reasons. Can we jab at it a whole bunch? Yes, please do because I know y'all are very kind, but just going through the front door, right? Yeah, exactly. The idea here is to be clear, you work for this company called Out Loud and Out Loud has been a great partner with Notem Questions for a long time. You help us get sponsorships with some of the companies that we know and love, but when you said, hey, we're doing this thing, we're going to build a brand, that's fascinating to me because Matt's built 10-minute Bible Hour. I've done the Smarter Every Day thing. We know what it's like to have to build a brand that's just like making content on the internet. What I don't know is what it's like to build a brand that sells physical products. That sounds like a whole different game with a whole different set of challenges and... And stakes? Yeah, I've had several people like my dads like, hey, I've got this idea for a product, but I want to know what it's like to start from not having a product to building a product and having to build a brand around that product, which would ultimately sell the product. So I don't know, Matt, do you have anything else before we get into this? Building a brand is building an intangible thing. It's choosing to set out at the beginning of a journey and say, this whole intangible relationship instead of meanings, we're going to intentionally create it. It's not an accident. That's hard to do with a podcast or with a YouTube channel. I have no idea what it's like to build that intangible set of meanings alongside the line of clothing. So yeah, I got questions. Agreed. So Brad, what is Muscox? What is this thing you're doing and why did you start? At the end of the day, we sell men's outdoor apparel, shirts, coats, vests. That's what we sell. But our brand is really something that is intended to connect with the spirit of who we are through ruggedness, quality features that are enduring. We launched the brand because we thought that there was an opportunity to help men get outside more, to help them explore. And also, if we're really honest, to help have that little piece of us that seems like it's dying in some ways, stay alive, which is that part of us that sees us as men who are outdoor adventurers and living that vision of who we want to be every day. And we get to build that in a brand. And that's really fun because it's not that it's not part of us. It's just that it's a smaller part of us than we'd like it to be if all other things were equal and we don't live in a world where all other things are equal. Yeah, as soon as you're saying, you want to be the kind of guy that gets to go outside and go on that mountain hike every weekend, even though you're not that kind of guy that gets going the mountain hike every weekend. That's right. And if I am that guy that gets to go out there, I want to have the best gear that's ready for me when I have that moment to seize. And that's why we built Muscox. Okay, I got one more. Let me ask it. This is going to sound rude. I haven't thought this through totally. Let's just give it a shot. I really resonate with all of those existential reasons for doing a project for taking on a thing. But this thing had to cost a crap ton of money to get started. To what extent are you also hoping to make money? Yeah. And startups do. Because it seems like a good idea with any company. Yeah, we'd like to make money. That's certainly a huge reason we're doing this. And if we're 10 years in and we're not making money and there's no very clear path to do so, then we need to stop doing it. Find another way to scratch that existential itch. Yeah. That's right. But my goodness, I'd like to hope and think that we can continue to change and evolve fast enough so that we don't hit that 10-year mark and are asking that same question. But to be clear, we're asking those questions today because we're not where we want to be. And to set up kind of your situation, you've been successful enough as the out loud group in what you're doing where you can kind of do this side hustle to try this other thing. Like you've been blessed in your primary function at your job and you're using some of the profits of what you've done to pour into this other thing that you're hoping to build another thing. Is that kind of the situation? Yeah, that's exactly right. So at the out loud group, we're an influencer agency and we've had the chance to learn a lot about things in terms of working with creators and we know the power of creators working with brands. But we've never created our own brand that's consumer facing. And so we've decided to do that with Muskox. And there's a lot to learn. I think we've done some things right, but we've got a whole lot more to learn. That's what's been a humbling process, but also a process that sparks that fire inside of me to try to figure things out and to continue to kind of grind on it and get it right. And we're getting closer. But like I said, we're not there. I'm invested in this before we even get into all of the backstory and everything for two reasons. Reason number one is I know and like the people who are doing this, we got history and I'm interested to see what happens when the brains of these people I know and like try something like this. Reason number two is because you just happen to be making a product that is in my wheelhouse and really resonates with the kind of things I like to buy. My favorite place to shop is the store that sells the kind of thing that you're trying to figure out how to make. And so this conversation is exciting for me because I feel like I get to jab at this, I get to poke at this, I get to help mentally workshop the kind of thing that I until now I've only ever been on the receiving end of as a customer. So it thanks in advance for letting me into your world a little bit to get to feel like I get to play in your sandbox. And I think that's what's fun about this is that who hasn't at some moment dreamed about starting a restaurant and who at some moment hasn't dreamed about starting a clothing apparel brand or selling some physical piece of something. And I've fall into that bucket and we haven't done a business before we're selling apparel, but we are now and it's a lot of fun, but it's not easy. Okay, so I know you all have to know that you wouldn't do this unless you thought you had a leg up. And so I think the model here is you're going to take advantage of those relationships you have with these content creators and kind of roll into what you're doing. Is that kind of what you're doing here? Yeah, you nailed it. I would probably not use a word take advantage of because, you know, that would be very short sighted seize the opportunity. Love it. Let's run with that to if you allow me to split hairs. So let me ask you this. How did you start it? You had to put money down, right? And you had to make people make clothes. How did you do that? Did you spend the money or did somebody else? Yeah, I spent the money as part of out loud. So Joel and I own the company and we made a decision to do this. So we're spending the money. Yeah. So when you decide to do that, where do you start? Do you start by saying, Hey, I need to go to a clothes manufacturer and I need somebody to make a jacket that I can then sell. And the only difference is I'm going to put like a little tag on it that says, Muskox, because that's what North Face does. And that's what Patagonia does, I assume. You don't own a loom, do you? We do not. That's correct. So how do you do that? I know you're super smart, but I've never seen you sew a jacket. How did you do that? Yeah, I'm going to stay in sales mode for one second. Okay. And then I'll actually answer this question. It's okay, everyone. I do not actually sew any of the Muskox gear and that you should be very thankful for. Okay. So yeah, I mean, it's hard. Our solution was let's find someone who knows this space extremely well. As it turns out, there's different places around the globe that specialize in specific fabrics at specific volumes. So if you're, if you're making 10,000 shirts versus making 200 shirts, there's different factories and places that are great in that. And for me or Joel to try to ramp up in that arena, that would take an inordinate amount of time, but someone who's very well versed in that, we could help articulate the brand to them and let them know what we wanted to do. And we brought someone on the team who is a designer, knows a thing or two about designing clothes. We took their advice and we got to a spot where they identified good factory partners that they knew of and had experienced with and trusted and we're on our way. That's risky, right? You pulled out the check and account, the checkbook or whatever. You sat down with this designer and you're like, I want to make clothes that blank. What did you say? And I'd prefer they be good. Yeah. Out of that conversation, go. Because I mean, this is a terrifying part of the process. You're actually putting money on the line, not knowing if you're going to get it back. Well, we had a conversation first in terms of trying to identify what the brand was, right? And we kind of talked about this quite a bit. It's important that it's rugged, quality has to be at the top. We want something that's enduring. We don't want something that's fast fashion. It can be modern. That's good. But we want something that's going to last 20 years for people. And those are important things. So with that as the backdrop, then we started to say, okay, well, we know no one knows about us. We know we're going to need to start small. What are the three or four things that we can launch with and allow people to start to get the Muscox products in their hands? And so after, I don't want to say a lot of research. The research is sort of our lives, right? In terms of knowing what we like and what was simple and comfortable and not too technical, we landed on rolling out flannels, henleys, a hooded sweatshirt and a crew neck sweatshirt. So you started there. And when you started there, did you get the first one back? Like you said, hey, designer, design this thing for me. Before they work with a manufacturer, they have to make some from scratch, right? They have to like, do they literally sit down with a sewing machine and make the first one? They don't. The way they designed it in CAD, right? So we saw, I don't know, probably 20 different versions in CAD drawings. Literally clothes you're made in CAD? They are, yes. Really? I would not have guessed this. I did not know this. Okay. So like three dimensional CAD. That's how they, so do they have an idealized human body and they're like, this is how this fits on this person? Yes. There are sort of prototypes which are different across regions and countries for a small, medium, large, extra, large person. Do they give you a wireframe of a person that you can put it on and do those wireframes have unflattering names for each body type? All right. We're going to try this on upside down pair man. I think we should shut down musk ox and go after this idea because it seems brilliant. This is fantastic. Like, do you have totally ripped bodybuilder dude and then you have like dad bod? Like, or is it just like one set of human wireframes that you put the clothes on? Yeah. So, I mean, and maybe this isn't the right way to do it, but there was one image that was created for us, just the product. And it was like, hey, what do we think about it? And then once we selected those images that we were a fan of and then we moved to finalist, at that point, we would go to actually getting a product that was constructed. And the way we did it was to just have one size. Luckily, we could lean upon Lindsey, our designer who knows a ton about sizing, right? Like, hey, what's the difference between a medium and a large and a small to a medium? And we just had to focus on what the size was. Now, if you didn't have someone on your team with this expertise, you'd have to worry about sizing and figuring all that out. But we just looked at what's the design that we like the most and then got it in person and got a chance to have a few different people who are who consider themselves to be a size large in this case to try it on. What was that day like when you got everything back for the first time? You know, in life, I've found that it's really hard to ever be able to celebrate something. This felt like one of those moments because you get something and it's not quite the way you drew it up in that, you know, certain things are too long, but also there's more practical things like, oh, those aren't the buttons that it will be. When they do this, they just have whatever buttons they have laying around or like, oh, that's not the color that the product will actually be. This is just a prototype to allow you to see and feel and the fabrics the same, but the color is different. You're getting this thing that you've created. You've spent all this time, energy and money and you kind of are looking at it like, yeah, this thing's kind of ugly and you have to be able to look beyond the visual characteristics to say, what's the fit? What's the quality and be able to trust that when you invest and it all comes together, it will look the way that you want it to. That's a hard thing to do when you're so excited for this moment. You're kind of like, yeah, I can see how that would be good. That's far different scenario than if you're like, oh, yeah, this is the stuff. Let's go. We got a winner. Is it still at the stage where you can see how it would be good and you're inching toward what you eventually hope it will be? Or did you get to the place where you could say, all right, now I can be excited and celebrate a thing because that is exactly what I wanted that pullover to be. We've gotten there with products for sure. I think individual products were there and we feel good about, you always want it to be better, right? I mean, sure, you've got a really successful YouTube channel and a really successful podcast, but you want it to be better, don't you? So I feel like we're there but recognizing that it's a journey and we'll always have to get better. But from a brand perspective, I don't think we're there yet. Okay. So here's the deal. There's the product side and then there's the brand side. So with no dumb questions, we did the brand first and then we started working on the product, which was us doing the podcast here. So you're kind of doing both in parallel. You're doing the brand in parallel with the product. In engineering, there's this thing called L-rip, low rate initial production. And so what you do is you come up with the design and you lock in the final design review and you like it. And I don't know anything about making clothes. So this is fascinating to me. I had no idea of clothes we're made in CAD. At what point do you say, okay, we got the first one back. We're going to make this change, this change, this change. When did you make the decision? Okay, we're ready to go to the first production run and we're ready to make a thousand of these or what were your numbers? And like, how did you know it was right and how did you get to the point where you were ready to pull the trigger? Really good question. And we were trying to make the final decision. At the end of the day, we were really fortunate that we knew we had some creators who were going to be helping us to share the word. And that gave us probably a little bit more willingness to say, okay, we're ready because we had to have other people involved who had to give us sort of the thumbs up. I want to know about how you knew when the shirt was ready. Okay, great. Yeah. We knew when the shirt was ready by pure gut feel at the end of the day. The designer who has a ton of industry expertise and had made a ton of different recommendations, we'd come to bear with five different ideas and concepts and things that we liked, right? We spent hours and hours and hours looking at different clothing to identify small pieces that we liked. We finally get to this prototype. And once we kind of got the intellectual reassurance that the colors can be different, we just started to look at every individual piece and ultimately was, one, will I wear this? Two, will I be comfortable in it? And three, am I excited to share this with my friends? And when the answer was yes, which are very subjective questions, it was time to step on the gas and hit go. And what did stepping on the gas look like? So you went from one shirt prototype kind of thing to like a thousand, two thousand? What was the first order? No, the first order was smaller than that. I believe it was in the neighborhood of 450 or 500. Still a big commitment. Big commitment to us. What was that check like? How much did you pay for the first run? I recall correctly, it was, and I could look this up to give you an exact answer, but it was in the neighborhood of $25,000. For 450 shirts. Well, in fairness, that was it. We had four different types of shirts that we launched together. So the flannels, the henleys, then a crew neck sweatshirt and a hooded sweatshirt. So this is 450 of each of those? That's right. Or 450. Okay. So we're talking about 1600 shirts, 25 grand. My goodness, that's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. So I assume a ton of this is for the setup though, right? It is. The thing is that costs go down quite a bit when your order volume goes up. And so when you're a nothing brand, a very small brand, I shouldn't say a nothing brand, but the manufacturer is literally starting from zero. You were literally starting from zero. So I think it's, I don't think it's a stretch to say at some point you were a nothing brand and you had to flip and then you had to create the brand. So. Yeah, that's right. So they mean they don't care about you. The costs are higher when you're doing smaller runs and also you have to pay for shipping to get the product. And this isn't even factoring in the fact that we weren't designers. So we're also paying a designer and then you have to get your website. How much did the designer cost? That I, great question. She's someone with years and years of experience. So not cheap. I don't know an exact number and I don't know if I feel quite comfortable. That's okay. Sharing someone's thinking. I'm going to keep asking about numbers. You don't have to answer. But thousands of dollars. I'm going to keep asking. Thousands of dollars. Thousands of dollars, yes. So this is what's happening in my head. We're at a poker table and Brad bets on this thing called musk ox and he's betting on a feeling. He's like, I think I can do this. And then he pushes money towards the center of the table. He said, I'm going to bet this much on this brand and that's the designer fee to begin with. And then he pushes $25,000 to the center of the table. He's putting it over the top of what he's already paid the designer. And then he's, he just keeps pushing money in and the bet is at some point this is going to pay off and I'm going to be profitable or at least not losing money. The risk is going up and up and up. That's hard, right? So you almost had to make these decisions before you sat down at the poker table, right? Yeah. And it keeps going. What do you mean? People want new gear every season. And so you're making these decisions a long time in advance because by the time you design something and then it gets on the calendar for a particular factory because for them to change over their looms and their machines to cut and so to create something the way you want it, that's a lot of effort. So they're planning months and months in advance. So you're screening the factories and they're seeing what their calendar looks like to you. So before we even receive that first run, we're sitting there saying, okay, this was for fall. What do we want to do for spring? And we need to make a decision like now if we want to get on that carousel of having new releases on a regular basis. So there's industrial inertia that you're fighting against. Like you're having to spin up the flywheel months in advance because I didn't think about that because the consumer market operates, you know, I buy my shorts in May. And so in order for my shorts to be purchased in May, you had to start spinning up the factory in November. Is that accurate? Is that about right? That's right. Yes. And we're behind bigger organizations are doing it 12 to 18 months in advance. How do they know what will be cool 12 to 18 months in advance? I wonder the same thing. Do you? How do you know what's going to be cool 12 to 18 months? I'm honest question. How do you guys know what's going to be cool? What assurance do you have that you won't think of something real cool that seems neat to you? And then it gets totally played out. Do you have any kind of way of preventing yourselves from thinking you're right on the cutting edge? You throw all the money and time at it and then it gets burned before you even get there? We're really lucky because we're a brand that's focused on trying to endure and to be more or less timeless. So we don't necessarily need to jump on the latest fads. That's not our customer anyways. So I think we're really fortunate that we know and understand what we're trying to. We're trying to know and understand our customer. We sure as heck aren't there yet. But we know that we're not going to be like the latest whiz bang fashionable thing. And that's not to say that we don't want to use technology that makes you have to our experience better. But that means when it comes to design and trends, we're okay not being that leader. That's not necessarily who we want to be. That's an interesting thing though because it means you're not going to win the hype train. You're not going to go on trending to think of it in terms of what we do. We try to get algorithmic momentum. We're mentioning the momentum you need to make things go. And then we get on trending. If you make the right kind of stuff, my brand is not made to be on YouTube trending ever. You will never see a 10 minute Bible hour video there. The appeal just isn't broad enough. So the buckle and the mall stores and maybe cool Prana North Face Columbia, maybe they could catch this crazy wave of we hit what was trendy across the fashion world just right on the upswing. But we did it with a little bit of an outdoor flair. Now we're going to make huge bank very quickly, but that stuff is going to look stupid in 12 months. And it is going to be on embarrassingly reduced clearance racks in the back of stores. I'm hearing you right. You're not playing the game so as to ever win that fashion upswing guessing game that what do you call it? Fashion speculation game. So you're looking at something much more slow and steady, but it means that you're out of that crazy explosive growth opportunity zone too. But it sounds like you're playing the long game. Like you're you're going to play the this is what we do and we do it well. And we're just going to win because it's a superior product in a long game. Is that what you're doing? That's exactly right. We feel like men appreciate quality, especially when it comes to outdoor apparel and that if we do that right, then over time people are going to start to trust muscocks. They're going to say, Hey, when I'm buying muscocks, I know I'm buying quality. But that's not easy to get off the ground because there's nothing to go off of. Right? 99.99% of Americans have never heard of muscocks, the men's outdoor apparel brand. So why should why should they trust us? What the heck does this brand mean to them? Why not just go buy something from the handful of brands that they know like in trust and can go to REI and buy today? And that's hard. That's a big hurdle. I want to do a quick reset on everything. Brad, this is what I'm hearing. You got together with Joel, some other friends. Where were you? Chili's where the idea first happened? Where were you sitting? Starbucks. That's where small business gets on. Was it a long conversation? Did you write things on napkins? Did you get excited? Was there energy to it? Absolutely. Absolutely. There's all sorts of excitement. There's back and forth. It's sort of been brewing for, Oh gosh, that's terrible pun. Now I was going to say, Percola, what did you do? Yeah, we're in dangerous territory. But you know, the idea had been in our heads, we've been kind of kicking around and then there comes a moment where you start to draw it on a piece of paper. Yeah. That's a moment it started to come real for us. So conversation number one, you talk about it, it goes from, huh, that would be cool. Yeah, maybe we should do that someday. It goes to somebody makes eye contact with somebody else at the table and they're like, well, what if we do it? Did that happen? Was there a moment where somebody lit the match and was like, I got the fuse right here. I got a burning match. You want, I could do nobody stopping me. I can send it again. Should I stop? I can do it. When did that happen? Here's how it went down. We had been working together with creators and a particular brand to have creators be the face of a big camo brand. Camo flush like things hunters wear. Exactly. Okay. And I don't mind sharing the names of the creators. We're working with Matt Carricker and Rob Turkla about like, demolition ranch. Yeah, that's right. Cool. We've been working with Matt for a long time and we are all excited. Hey, like this is going to be a really cool deal. It's taken things to the next level. I love the depth of this partnership and it got real exciting. And then we started to hit roadblocks and ultimately this deal fell through to be clear that the deal with the camouflage company fell through. So you were working with Matt and this other gentleman. What was the other creators name? Rob Turkla. Yeah. Rob. You're a great- Okay. So you got Matt who's all guns. You got fishing guy going to the camo people trying to work a deal out for them for out loud. And then that should work. And yeah, that sounds like it worked, but it fell through on the camo side. It did. Yeah. And it started to get rocky, right? You can start to see when something might not happen and your brain starts, starts turning gears and this is kind of where this idea came up. It's like, you know, if this doesn't work, we can start our own brand. Do we need this existing brand to help create something? And our answer kept being no, but let's see if this plays out. Let's see how this deal goes. And then like we talked about, the deal fell through. So we kept talking about it. I was like, hey, Matt, what do you think about this? Because we had a lot of, you know, a lot of trust that had been established. And he was like, you know, I'm not really a close guy, but it seems like a pretty good idea. I think we should do it. So we have this great plan, right? We're excited. We're moving forward with everything. And next thing you know, unbeknownst to us, Matt had started this knife company and the knife company goes live and his customers and audience are really unhappy. Turns out the knives were perfectly good, but they're selling them as $80 knives and they should have been $40 knives. And Matt handled it fantastically well. You know, apologize to his audience. Use the price from 80 to 40. And for anyone who paid 80, they refunded $40, you know, handled it fantastically. But his takeaway from that was I do not want to burden my audience with the idea that I'm ever taking advantage of them. And so I don't ever want to create a new brand and put it out there for fear. I'm going to upset my audience. And so here at Muskox, as we talked about, we've got this six, nine month window before you actually have product where you need to commit. You need to write that check. So you had already committed by the time the knife thing went down. We had. Yes. So we commit knife thing goes down. And then Matt says, guys, like, I love you, but I don't really think I can do this in good conscience. And so we had this great plan, you know, we're going to we're going to do this. We work with creators all the time. And next thing you know, we're sort of at ground zero when we thought we had this, you know, secret advantage. And that's sort of been something that's really challenging from us because at the beginning, when we were trying to figure out what are the right clothing items, we kept thinking, well, what would Matt wear? What's going to really resonate with him and his audience? For time, we've pivoted from what would Matt wear to like, Hey, what, what did Joel and Brad want? And what do we think is really going to help people to make their outdoor experience better. So in some ways, we actually started a disadvantage because of that. And it's no fault of anyone. But we've had to kind of have conversation after conversation of like, Hey, what, what are we really? And that's a hard thing for a brand to have to continue to turn on in those early years, because we want people to see the brand. We don't need everybody to like it. You know, we're big believers that you want 20% of the people to love you, not 80% of the people that like you, but to get those 20% of people to love you, you got to be really clear who you are and who you aren't. And even these subtle shifts really take away your ability to connect with that audience that really loves you. It's been an interesting road to get here. What did you figure out was the difference between what you thought Matt would wear and what you actually wanted to wear? So when you think about an outdoorsman, I think there's a lot of things that can come to mind. You could be a skier. You could be a fly fisherman. You could be a hunter. You could be someone who goes for a walk with their children. You could be someone who goes backpacking for two weeks. There's a big range of people who consider themselves to be outdoors. And Matt, great guy, great audience, but he tends to be a little bit more of like the casual day to day person who's outdoors, which I don't resonate with, by the way, gun guy outdoors, not my thing. Cabela's is not a place that I tend to shop. Cabela's a great store, great company. I don't like their fly fishing department. The kind of outdoors I do is different than the kind of outdoors that gun guy does. And if you're not into this kind of stuff, it might be very difficult to understand the difference between the two, but I can tell the difference between what gun guy would buy and what I want to wear. And it's a subtle difference. I don't have a problem with gun guy. I'm just not that and I don't want to project that. And the practical things that gun guy outfit is supposed to do, it doesn't benefit the things I do outside. What I'm saying is I resonate with that. I really hear you. Yeah. What that makes me think of is there's subcategories of brands. So like computers, you've got the gamer that's going to want their computer all RGB, LED out. You know, they get all the lights on it for the gamer person. Then you got the coder that's doing things different, always running Linux. You know, you want, you've got these different things that you optimize for. So not only are you thinking about being an outdoor brand, you're kind of optimizing in a specific subcategory of an outdoor person and you're trying to find your way within that. Is that what I understand? Yes. And this is where the struggle is, is that we didn't start with a specific outdoor activity and then say, we are going to work with those people. We're going to find experts in the space and really help to build around that. We started with more of a casual outdoors and now we're going into sort of cross sport, cross activity apparel that is really, really good, but it's more of like a base layer that could work across sports, right? So as an example, right, hey, we have this, you know, great base layer that you could wear to go skiing or tobogganing or skating, you know, really any activity outside or frankly, if you're hunting outside, it could work great. And that's really hard to try to do things based on quality and such a broad categorization as a new brand. And this is where frankly, we need to do better and dial things in. I'm starting to see the matrix here. So, so you're saying that if you are too general, if you're too broad and you're like, hey, we make a great jacket for cold or whatever, then you appeal to everyone just a little bit. You don't have that one person that's just fired up enough to actually pull out a credit card and buy your product. So you're trying to like laser beam on these specific subcategory of people that will actually be motivated to buy your product. So what subcategory are you thinking matches with you? So if I hear you correctly, you don't know and you're figuring that out. Is that true? We're absolutely figuring it out. And I wish I could sit here and say, Matt, Destin and DQ listeners, we've got the answer, but we don't. And we're at a spot where we have really good products that work really well for outdoor for lots of outdoor adventures. But the question isn't do they work really well and are they well made? It's I think what's that one thing that you're willing to risk the brand on and stake the brand on? And frankly, that takes a lot of cajonets to say, this is what we're going to do. And I haven't been bold enough yet to really do that. I'm trying to learn and get information and see what resonates. And we could talk about some of those tests that we're doing. But at the end of the day, I know that we need to dial as a brand and to be as specific as possible to be successful. I'm sure as heck not comparing ourselves to Amazon, but Amazon didn't start out selling everything known to man online. They started out selling books and they were an online bookstore. And that specificity is what allowed them to go broad. And I see the vision for us being broad, but I don't know the answer for what the specific thing is first to get us to be able to be broad. So we're sort of in this weird middle ground at Muscox. Man, that's really fascinating because if you're broad, if your appeal is we make good coats or we make good, whatever, then you're up against literally every other coat on Amazon. You're up against everyone and you have to have that laser beam focus so that you can differentiate yourself. Like you have to have some type of differentiation from everyone else in order to provide the activation energy for someone to make the purchase. This is what I wanted to know. How do you build a brand? This is the meat of what I wanted to learn from you and what I hope to learn from probing your brain here. So how are you trying to figure that out? Like what is the way you're figuring out which next step to take? So we're talking a lot. We're thinking a lot. I don't know that we have the best approach, but maybe I can share a few examples for the types of things that we're thinking about. One of the things, the ways that we could really narrow in is that we to date have used zero animal products in Muscox production to date. We think that's pretty interesting, right? I had assumed the whole thing was made of endangered Muscox. Are they endangered? No, they're not at this stage. Would it be better for you if they were endangered? I know a guy. I know a guy. I don't know a girl this destined. That doesn't seem to be a bit more. Well, it seems like that would be good branding. We are going to save the puffin or whatever the endangered whatever is. It's kind of a joke, but it's kind of like that would have given you more things to hang your hat on. It's interesting. Let me tell you what we are doing because we're named after rugged outdoor beast in the Muscox. That's pretty cool. But we're big believers of like, hey, how does someone going to really know about us and know that we're authentic about that? And oh, by the way, help to tell the story of the Muscox animal because it's actually fascinating. So, you know, at the risk of sounding too salesy, when someone makes a $100 purchase, we kick $10 to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center. They actually are doing things to save not only Muscox, but all sorts of animals in Alaska. And they do amazing things. We've actually named a bunch of our clothing items after Muscox that they have at the AWCC, which is pretty cool. To build that out where we've thought about, and this is just a thought, is that do we want to really lean in on the idea that we're cruelty-free as a brand and we are supporting animals and conservation of animals. So if you really believe in that angle, then Muscox is the brand for you. But if you lean into that angle by using the phrase cruelty-free, you're in toning that if anyone wears anything that's made of an animal, they're pro-cruelty. So there's your 2080 rule again. You want that 20% to love you or you want that 80% to like you because any hard flag in the ground like that is a provocation of people who see that different. I mean, I don't think anybody wants animals tortured and maimed, but I'm willing to go on record. If there are some animal products and things that I buy, well, I don't know, animal products are part of things. I guess I'd want to know what kind of animal product. How did that happen? How did that work? I would associate immediately somebody who says cruelty-free. That sounds like one of those exaggerated phrases. Everybody has connotations with every marketing phrase, every marketing line. Anything you pick, you're choosing, you're selecting, you're narrowing down on that audience before you even get out of the gate. Yeah, you want to be so narrow that you can find your niche, but not too narrow where you eliminate some people within that niche. When you're focusing that lens, you don't want to go so narrow where you're like, well, we want lumberjacks that have never killed a squirrel. Cruelty-free almost seems like it's edging towards the political. Maybe it's not. So is that something that you've actively thought about or did you kind of just stumble into that? No, we've actively thought about it. I agree with your reservations around it. That's why we haven't really leaned into it. We've done some light testing on some Facebook ads and so forth. But that's confusing too. You broke up a little bit. You said you've done some light testing on little baby monkeys with Downie fur. That's what I heard. Nailed it. In addition to testing on those monkeys, we've also done some light testing on Facebook. That's confusing too because if you run an ad on Facebook saying, here's who we are, and you're just trying to test to see how do people respond to it, and then they go to your website and your website isn't built around that, sort of a head scratcher. Yeah. Feels like a bait and switch. Yeah, it does. Now, the good thing is with the animal conservation piece, we're pretty authentic in that we want to help preserve and conserve and support wildlife. So we think that's an important part of the outdoors. Strong, yes. You speak loudest when you speak with your pocketbook, right? So we do donate that money now. So it's sort of like, well, there's a pocket of people who are super into that. So I like the idea, the concept at a high level of building that out a little bit. But I don't think that I'm not convinced yet that really leaning into that cruelty-free angle is the right way to achieve that. And here's one of the reservations I have about it. Now we're workshopping your brand a little bit. As we get into this, let me just say, obviously ignore anything you want. I'm just thinking out loud here. But at this point in history, I think everybody's pro animal and even the people who outsiders to the world of hunting and fishing might imagine are anti animal. Like for example, I like to trick fish into eating a fake bug that they thought looked delicious so that a hook goes into their mouth and then I yank them in all of their body weight against a current using that hook that's in their face. And you know why? Because I love them. I don't do that because I hate trout. I do that because I think they're a marvel of creation and one of the most incredible creatures I could even imagine. And then I look at them and I put them right back in the water and there often I hope that I see them again someday. Some people eat them. I think that's fine too. But even the people who want to hunt and fish the animals, we can't do that if they're aren't the animals anymore. I'm intimately familiar with the ebb and flow of trout populations in water that I know really well. And I'm very invested in that. I can't think of anyone save like a fifth grade bully who just likes burning ants with magnifying glasses because they haven't developed a moral conscience yet. I can't think of anybody now who would be anti conservation, anti care for animals. And so I wonder if a brand is about distinguishing yourself from other places. I wonder if rather than that being a distinguishing mark, what you're talking about there, if that's just more of a baseline of expectations to even be in the space, you've got to be doing something redemptive. You've got to be contributing to the welfare of something beyond yourself and that you need almost something beyond that to set yourself apart from all of the competition. Do you think that makes sense? It makes a lot of sense. I love workshop in the brand and keep the ideas coming. I think where my head goes with this mat, though, is I think there's a difference between liking the outdoors and spending four nights a week where you're sleeping under the stars. And similarly, there's a difference between liking animals and becoming vegan and living in a way that you're not supporting the potential harm or potential death, not to be morbid, of these animals that you claim to love. I think this goes back to there's a difference between the 20% and the 80% here. There's 20% of the people who I think would really appreciate that. And frankly, I think younger generations resonate with that more so than us guys here in our, well, we'll just say old guys, right? We don't get into specific ages. But there's a lot of reasons that you said that do resonate with me and are why I haven't said, let's take this direction for the brand. Real quick, what is the website? Go muscox.com. Okay, let's go here and check this out. Okay, look at this. You've got made in America on here, design and manufactured in Detroit. Are you, you are literally made in America? We have products that are made in America. So not everything is made in America and we try to be clear about that. But we are, we are looking to, and this is another place that we could differentiate. So you zero down it right away is if we want to have everything made in America, we could ultimately do that. It would take a tremendous amount of heavy lifting, but the costs are going to be so much more. And in some cases, I would say the quality would be less, but we're not going to ultimately sacrifice on quality. So we would reduce the range of garments that we could create based on doing it in the US. And so that can be challenging for folks as well, where we're proud that we do have a facility in Detroit where we're making muscox items. But most of our stuff is still not yet made in America, but we're spending a lot of time energy and effort to try to have as many as possible. And that's a really bad marketing message like, Hey, we're trying really hard. And more of our stuff is being made in America, but most of it is made overseas. And that's where we are right now. I totally get it. It sounds great to say made in America until you actually try to do it. And Destin, you've been turning an eye toward manufacturing and you're seeing the difficulty of making things. I mean, to be able to truly say 100% of this product is American made. How difficult is that? It's crazy hard. So I'm working on a thing right now with a guy locally. We're making a product and there's one specific component that we cannot buy a made in America version. And it's infuriating. It's like, what are we losing our edge? Another thing I see on your website here says our brand and you have immediately you have a thing that says our story. So you're trying to build a story around the brand. And it says, I'm looking at adventure is everywhere at muscox. We believe in the power of the outdoors and the need to stay connected with adventure and wildlife. I like that. That's pretty good. While we may not be climbing peaks or braving Arctic weather like the muscox, we connect with the rugged pursuit of something great at muscox. We make clothing that brings the outdoors into everyday life with thoughtful design and performance features that simply make your life better. When you wear muscox, you support American wildlife and the active pursuit of adventure. What can be better than looking good and supporting the environment that surrounds you? That's a pretty good message. So basically, you're trying to brand yourself as an outdoor brand that actually contributes to conservationist type messaging. Is that what you're going for here? Yeah, definitely. We like to say, we're an outdoor brand that gives a ****. So basically, you are trying to put your money where your mouth is and that's the brand. So that means that you're competing against Patagonia and it feels like the Tom's about door brands. Is that what you're trying to do? Somewhat. Obviously, Tom says the buy one, give one model and we just want to make sure that people know that we really mean this and we're not just doing this to make a buck, but we want to do what we can to get guys outside and to help increase the appreciation of the outdoors and make the outdoors better. And those are lofty goals for folks that are ultimately selling shirts. I don't know if I want to call what I'm going to say next in objection, but it is. So I guess I'd better call it an objection. I would like to lodge an objection. If a brand and the features of a story and the features of what makes a brand a brand are to distinguish it from something that is similar, I hear that story and I can't help but think that I can't name an outdoor clothing brand I do business with or have heard of that doesn't have the same values. I don't mean that as a dig, my friend, at all. I'm just trying to honestly workshop it. I think it's true. I can't think of anything. We got a store in Lander that I shopped out. We got one downtown here in Rapid City. I cannot think of a single brand big or small that I could get at the kind of outdoor store I would go to that doesn't have the exact same list of values. The only place where I see the dials tuned one way or the other is just how serious are we about this. That seems like a baseline to me at this point. What elements have you guys been workshopping that you're maybe banding about behind the scenes a little bit that really differentiator put you in a completely different place? I think one of the things is the magnitude of what you're calling table stakes. I think we're pretty serious about that and I think those dollars speak to it. In terms of other differentiators, we do tend to be really thoughtful about some of the features that make guys' lives easier. We're huge on having something as simple as locker loops. Those little loops you can have in the back of your shirt. You do don't actually have to hang them up. You can just walk in, hang them up, and then keep wearing them, keep wearing them, keep wearing them. That's something that's part of all of our year. In addition to that, we have these little sunglass holder bungee cords that are in most of our shirts that are designed for summer. That way you're not going to lose your sunglasses. Small, little thoughtful things that guys appreciate. We have thumb holes, which a lot of people appreciate, particularly whether they're in more technical, whether it's rock climbing or running. We have some features that we have been really thoughtful about. We're getting into this functions and features type of world where we can talk about individual products being cooling and SPF blocking and all that sort of stuff. We can nerd out on that. We try to make sure that what we're doing is really thoughtful and really based on quality and something that's going to last in the long term. I think matters. I think it helps. I don't think it really answers your question in a way that's satisfying to me. Frank, I suspect people who are listening to this say, okay, Brad, that's cool. I'm glad you're doing that. How does that really differentiate you all? I think that's something that we, again, still need to come up with a better, crisper, clearer answer to. Not from a marketing perspective, but we need customers to know and understand that distinction. Let's think about the brand for a second. When I think of a musk ox, I think of a big animal in the cold. I'm looking at your website here and I'm seeing summer stuff. Like that seems like a mismatch to me. No, I think you're spot on. I mean, musk ox have the most insulated fur on the planet. They are cold weather masters. With that said, and this is something that I'd be interested in your take on, not a lot of people are buying super insulated gear in months of June and July. The musk ox have two layers to their fur as well. They have an inner kivit, which is super insulating. I think of that as winter insulation. Then they have the longer hair that you'd come to think of with the musk ox and that's kind of what you can see and they keep that year round. The thinking is kind of like, well, the musk ox has these two layers and we can do that too, where we have an insulation layer for the winter, but then a lighter layer for the outside, or something for the summer months. That seems like it's kind of confusing. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot to explain. You have to sit down with somebody and explain, oh yeah, well, there's this animal called the musk ox and it has this blah, blah, blah. You have to explain all that in order for me to care, no offense. I don't think that's worth your time. You kind of have to just make good stuff and hope somebody puts it on and appreciates it. What is selling the most right now on your website? Well, right now we're recording officially in summer now. We have these sun shirts that sell really well, which we call the Charleston. We have the ultra light performance hoodie and this is the classic performance hoodie. These are very thin long sleeve shirts that have those cooling properties. They have the thumb, the thumb loops are great for hiking or for any sort of activity where you want to protect yourself from the sun, but also you want to stay as cool as possible. But if you take a step back, people love our flannels. Our flannels are our best seller. They're really well constructed. They are thick. They're warm. If you're looking for a light flannel, this is not the flannel for you. I think you're on to something, Destin, in terms of really leaning into the winter piece. We've talked about that a lot at Muskox. We're also continuing to spin our wheels a bit on saying, okay, it's kind of like going back to the South Dorsman question. Winter sports are really big. Being outdoors is really big. Where do we want to play in the winter space even? I'd love your take on if you think leaning into winter is too broad or if you think that gets us to where we need to be in terms of being a brand that's differentiated in the market because I might be too close to the brand to really answer that. I went to the website and I'm looking at it and I'm just looking at what I would like. I found this one called the grand flannel. That's exactly what I have up right now. I zoomed in on it and I was like, okay, oh, wow, I like that color. I like the way it looks. I'm said, I want one in large and I click on it and it's sold out. Tell me about that. That sounds like if I had to guess sounds like you tried to make these things, you found one that hit and it's like, well, heck, we didn't order enough. Is that true? It might be true. Here's another layer that we haven't talked about at all, which is logistics and being able to fulfill all of our inventory. We're actually in the process of changing fulfillment from a third-party fulfillment center to something that we're going to take on all ourselves in-house. As we push more chips to the center of the poker table, I see. We are. As we're doing that, some of the gear is in transit from one location to another. Rather than try to have too long of a delay, some of it's marked is out just in the interim, but some of it is legitimately sold out and size broken as well. Man, this is hard. This is hard. It is hard. So when I think of a muscox, I think of that insulation. I think of something that will stubbornly ram its head against something else again and again until it's like that was about enough and then wander off and do something else. I think of a little bit of frozen snot and drool. I think of the great white north and I think of a muscox as being not like a white-tailed deer that you might come upon when you're sitting down in the holler. It's like, you got to want that. You don't just happen upon a muscox. Most people have surely never seen one of those in the wild. So one of the things I really like about the brand right off the top is it's the kind of animal that takes work. Another thing I like about the brand right off the top is there's a stubbornness to it. And I like the way the stubbornness lines up with your story about, yep, these are dudes who have jobs at work. I'm looking at the all shirts banner photo and I see three dudes here. I know two of you and those are dudes who go to work a lot. And also you remember what it was like to be outside a lot and you would like two more. So I like the muscox, the stubbornness that says, I am not giving up on this part of who I am. So there's a ton of stuff that I think overlaps really well with the story. To me, the biggest hang up is when I move away from this page where I see fall colors and dudes looking like they need something that would line up with a muscox brand to the main page. And I see summer stuff and muscox does not make me think of guys jogging on a bridge in shorts. But the last thing I would want to have around me when I'm doing that is the fur of a muscox. If you gave me an option between, I'll just do it naked or the muscox. Like I think I'm going birthday suit there. And so it really is a very difficult brand challenge, I think, for you guys to branch out beyond the things that muscox naturally conjures and into this broader spectrum. But if you don't do it, what do you sell for six months out of the year? Now, I do like these all momentum. Did you just look at the T-shirts, Matt? Go to shirts. They're gorgeous. The shirts are spectacular. Yeah, those T-shirts that the graphic tease, those are cool. What are your thoughts on that, Brad? This is where being someone who works in business can sometimes obfuscate big word what the real answer is for something like an outdoors brand. And I think saying, well, what are we going to sell in the summer is a really bad answer to a justification for why you wouldn't lean into the core tenets of muscox. And I think you nailed it, Matt, with sort of the ruggedness, the stubbornness, the ability to withstand really significant challenges in weather and changes in dynamics. Can take a hit? Yeah. I think we need to do more in terms of leaning into the characteristics of the muscox. And we've talked a lot about this and we need to finalize some of these big decisions and to be willing to say no. I think that's one of the hardest questions for any business or any individual in terms of like, where are you spending your time? The way I like to phrase this, what are you willing to say no to? Are we selling products or are we building a brand? And we're not doing this just to sell product. We're really trying to create a brand that's going to last. And in order to do that, we've got to be able to focus. And if winter is where we go, then we're going to have to liquidate a lot of this summer stuff and really lean into who we really are. And there's plenty of brands out there who are successful in focusing on a particular season. So I don't think we need to do for four quarters a year, even though our brains are wired to wanting to win every single month, every single quarter. But that's sometimes how you lose. Are we your target audience? You know us pretty well. Do we fit within the boundaries of who you're trying to connect with? That you for sure are part of the target audience. I mean. So what's wrong with Destin? No, it's a serious question though. That's it is a serious question. Yeah. Well, just on opportunity to mock you. Just for fun, the name for Muscox actually means animal with skin like a beard. So I think Destin being clean shaven, you know, that's why there's no beard there. It's just a decision that Destin makes to shave the beard that would otherwise flourish. I see the joke, but I also there's some seriousness here and I think that's interesting. Like the mountain man kind of feel is part of what you're going for. My brand would be more of a soft nerdy type, right? Look, at the end of the day, I don't think this is a hot take to say we're happy for anyone to buy our products, but all customers were not created equal. And we want to create products that people are going to really love that are in that narrow lane of the rugged outdoorsman. And regardless of how often you actually do get outside and to experience those things, someone who has that self identity as someone who appreciates and loves to be outdoors and to pursue adventure outdoors. That's really who our target market is. So right now, I am enormously brand loyal to Obaz shoes to I don't even I've never known if I say it right. I assume it's not oboes because that sounds weird, but that's what I buy. I buy Prana pants and that's pretty much it. Save some Mac weld and I bought because you guys got me connected with them and I like their stuff for my lounge around pants. And I wear a bunch of Kavu flannels, real heavy flannels, some cool occasionally I'll do a Columbia or North Face, but usually more in that exclusively outdoor store kind of range in terms of tops, pullovers, things like that. So what you're telling me is that you would like to displace one or more of those brands to be in my short rotation of stuff that I buy someone like me and have me not just be like, oh, yeah, that's cool. I would wear that one. But instead, I can't wait to see what MuscoX comes up with this year. It always works. It never goes wrong. Customer service is great. I like the story it tells. I am willing to marry my personal brand as a guy who likes the outside to MuscoX. Is that what I'm hearing? You nailed it. Now we are David and we got a slingshot and we're trying to shoot it. Do you feel like you have to slay the Goliath in order to win or do you feel like you have to just survive and find a niche market? No, I think it's more the latter. I mean, the big guys, they're not going anywhere. Thank you. I like them. Yeah, they do good work. There's nothing wrong with that. And we think there's an opportunity to continue to modernize as a brand, not modernize again, from the perspective of being the most trendy. But we're a new modern brand that tries to understand men and their desire to seek out outdoor adventure and to put together quality stuff that makes their adventure easier and has thoughtful features along the way. I Googled Go MuscoX and I found out that you guys have a physical store. Really? Yeah, there's a physical store. And so that... Detroit? Yeah, that's not what I expected. I expected you guys to be a completely online brand. But what's up with this? That seems like you pushed a lot of chips to the middle. What's going on here? So that's interesting. So something in the algorithm is gone wrong. So we have had a physical store. We launched a pop-up store in suburban Detroit over the holidays. And that was something we were really excited about. It did well, but we did decide to close that at the end of February. We are clearly an online retailer, but we don't have a retail store at this moment. But let me tell you this. I'm seeing some pictures on Google and that's a store I would walk into around November. Maybe October. I see Go MuscoX up top. I see the flannel in the window. I see some pictures in the background of people in the mountains. I'm walking in that store. Maybe it's interesting where this brand presents itself in a physical form. Like you just see that image. You instantly understand everything about it. Whereas if I'm online, I'm trying to make a living on Instagram ads or something like that. It doesn't present like that. There's a tangible nature to what you're doing and you're trying to win the battle in a digital landscape. That's difficult. It is difficult. And I think you hit on something that's super interesting and that we've found when we've gone and done these little pop-up stores around the holidays or some festival and were invited to attend. And obviously the last year hasn't afforded a lot of opportunities for that. But prior to that, we sold a lot of stuff because people got a chance to see and feel and touch the quality of it, which is tough to know from an online photograph. And we sold a lot of it. That was really what prompted us to say, huh, maybe we should open a retail store because prices are pretty low right now in terms of being able to rent out a storefront. And so we did that now. We're at a spot where that's something we can absolutely reconsider. And if we were to open up a retail store, not in a pop-up capacity, where would we want to go and where would we be? This is another interesting, fascinating debate where it's like, well, do you go somewhere where there's a lot of foot traffic? Or do you go somewhere that really resonates with the brand? And I think that's another set of really interesting questions for us to figure out. So where are you at, Brad? You're doing a hard thing, man. You're making a brand that really revolves around me walking up and feeling the shirt. That's the first thing you do when you buy a shirt is you feel it and how soft is that? Or in this case, how thick is that? How rugged is that? You know, that's what you need to feel in order to close the deal. That's what you're trying to do. You're doing a hard thing. So where are you at with all this, man? I think it's important to stay the course in terms of what we're doing, right? Because we're not flashy. We're not sexy. But we do really good stuff. And over time, the truth sort of rises to the surface. So I think on one hand, we've got to be willing to stay the course and let people start to talk. We are getting some good word of mouth. It's not a very small scale relative to some of the other players that we've discussed on this podcast. So I think we need to be patient. On the other hand, we need to make a decision. We need to pick a lane for the brand and lean into it a lot further than we have. I haven't done a great job leading lately because I've sort of been kicking the can on this a little bit. And it's okay in some ways because right now the spring and summer stuff is out. It's up. So we're not at an inflection point where we need to make an investment in warm weather gear. We're for sure going to continue investing the cold weather gear. So we're doing that. Sure. We need to make a decision for the direction of the brand. And we talked through a couple of them, right? Hey, we could go leading to the animal piece. We could lean into the cold weather outdoors. We could pick a particular sport or two and try to really lean in there or activities. We need to make a choice and be willing to say no to something. That's the number one thing that's on my list when it comes to Muscocs right now. Is it possible that you end up putting your products in shields, REI, that kind of model? We'd love to. This goes back to the cost structure because we are small. The cost per unit for us to make is higher. So we're not making a ton of money on every individual item. You want to be in the 50 to 60 percent margin. So meaning if you're selling something for $100, it costs you 50 is where you want to be. We're not quite there yet. We're close. But that applies too when you're talking about selling it to shields or REI. If shields is paying you $100, you want your cost to be around 50 bucks in order to make everything work. We don't have room in our pricing right now to be able to do that at scale. But for us to really be able to get to that scale where we could sell in retail as you're proposing that, we'd have to take a whole bunch of chips going back to your analogy destined to push even more into the center of the table. That's scary too. Which probably isn't worth doing until you've really got the idea crystallized. Thanks for being honest about the fact that it isn't yet. That's incredibly encouraging to everybody sitting in on this conversation. Because here's the thing. The idea isn't perfect yet by your own evaluation. But it's pretty good and it's off to a good start. I think a lot of people when they sit around and think about what it would take for them to make a thing or take a risk or have a second project or whatever, they imagine this thing has got to be completely dialed before you can ever go. And listening to you talk, it sounds like completely dialed before you ever hit launch. Maybe isn't very realistic. And if you wait around forever until you got everything dialed, you're going to wait around forever. At some point you have to do something. And it seems like at some point in all of this, you reached that pivot point where you were like, all right, the idea is good enough. Let's try it. As some of this, we're just going to have to learn after we do it. I mean, what would you say to somebody who's like, man, I guess I'm going to follow that model too. I have maybe a good enough idea to give this thing a try. I'm going to hit go. At what point does it make sense to hit go and take a swing at the thing? You know, when it's time, you'll know. I think surrounding yourself with people who are willing to give you that nudge, give you that teeny ounce of pressure is really healthy. But so many of us, we try to get things perfect. One of the things that I like to say and I sure as heck didn't come up with this is don't let perfect be the enemy of good. When you've got something that's good, you need to go after it because, you know, in the startup world, we say execution needs strategy for breakfast. Strategies important. Shoot, I used to be a strategy consultant years in the past, executing, learning from your customers, changing, evolving, and just making sure you're continuing to improve and do things the right way. That's how you win. We're trying to make things better. But I don't think we've figured everything out. So that's something we're trying to solve. And it's really helpful to be able to kick this around with two really smart guys like yourself. So I appreciate your willingness to dive in and be good friends in that you're challenging in poking holes. That to me is a sign of progress. Thank you for letting us do that, by the way. Straight to the front door. I think both Dustin and I agree that we thought it would be a lot more interesting and value providing conversation. If we did poke and jab and flip it over and take it apart on the table and think about it, this is your baby. You got a ton of effort in this thing. So for you to demonstrate just the sheer social maturity to let a couple of people who are outsiders and don't have any time in it is so easy for us to make this cavalier observation or why didn't you do this? Thank you for your grace and humility in giving us permission and trust to poke at that. Thank you for being willing to spend the time on. I know it's not always easy and you guys tackle in some of those challenges head on. These are things we've talked about a lot of them, not all of them. It's good to talk about. It's great to hear your insights. Now comes the important time is we need to start to make some tough decisions. That's one of the things Matt and I were talking about before you got on about how much we admire the fact that you're a doer. You do things and you actually take risks and you're willing to try. There are a lot of people, myself included sometimes, to be paralyzed by that fear and like, well, I don't know, it might not work. I'm not going to do it. So you kind of, I don't know, you seem to zoom past that phase and actually do things. So the last question I have from my side is just pretty blunt. I hope that's cool. But my question is, are you scared to fail? Like are you scared this will fail? And how do you deal with that? Yes. I'm very scared that it will will fail. But I believe that it will be successful. I believe that even if somehow it doesn't go the way we plan and we don't ultimately sell these things, I will have made a connection or my team will have made connections that will be extremely valuable to them. I've come to believe that things don't happen in a linear way that you draw it up. There's tremendous value in drawing up the linear path. Right? It's the hypothesis is super important. It's like a financial model. It's going to be wrong every single time, but there's still value in doing it. My life has not been a linear journey. And I take solace in that when we're having those dark moments, we're like, Oh, gosh, we're our sales are. Wow, how are we missing things as a brand? This doesn't seem like it embodies what we want Muscox to be in those moments. I'm lucky that I've been around starting some things. I've seen that it's kind of these failures or these challenges that in the long run tend to be the most valuable. And so I'm sort of staking a claim here where I'm believing that these challenges, these struggles are ultimately worth it. Even if it's not the goal that we set out at the beginning to achieve. And that makes it a lot easier for me to be honest with you is that one way or another Muscox is going to be successful. That doesn't mean that the brand will always exist. It doesn't mean that we're going to sell millions of dollars of clothes. But one way or another, it's going to make an impact on my life, some people's lives or team's life. And that's the part that I'm 100% convinced of. And that's the part that makes doing Muscox really exciting to me every day. Well, I hope you sell a lot of clothes for what that's worth. Me too. So thank you very much, Brad. Really appreciate your time here, man. This was great. Is it okay if we maybe check back in with you at different points along the way? Like if this journey takes a turn, is it okay? Maybe not a whole episode, but can we maybe drop in at some point and maybe do a small segment and just check in to see how the brand is going? I think that'd be a lot of fun, but only if you promise to continue to be honest and challenge what we're doing. Yeah, deal. Yeah, I think that'd be cool. I'm kind of emotionally invested in this thing you're doing. And I feel risk with you. You're pushing these chips forward. And now that I understand what's going on in your head, it helps me understand like, man, this is an interesting thing. So I'm going to check in every once in a while on Instagram or whatever you're doing. And I'm going to see like how the brand has developed. And I think that's going to be really fun for me. It kind of feels like the Sims a little bit. Like I get to see somebody building a thing or like roller coaster tycoon or something. I get to check in on your thing and see how it's going. Matt, does that make any sense? It makes perfect sense. I think it's a great idea. Can't wait to have you guys on the journey. We appreciate it. It's been a couple of days since we recorded that conversation. And I've had some more time to think about the whole Muscox brand in general, stuff that makes sense to me, stuff I still have questions about. But I'm going to let you go first. What are you thinking after a couple of days? Well, one thing that occurs to me is it's easy for me to look at someone else's brand and be like, Oh, well, why are you doing this? And you should be doing that. And that's not what your brand is. And it makes me realize that I probably have those own things with my own brand. You know, like your work brand as well as your personal human brand, or at least that's where my brand goes with me. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so this is where I'm at with Muscox. It seems to be centered on fall, winter, maybe early spring, like cold weather because Muscox is like a cold weather animal in my head. Hard core. And so to me, to have like a summer line seems like a waste of energy. It seems like you might not get out of it what you put into it. And so my thought was if they were to focus on the flannels and the coats and the cold weather stuff, but also have T-shirts just for the graphic T, like the purpose of the T-shirt line would be to further the brand itself. But I don't think you try to do like running gear. What are you thinking? I strongly agree, man. If I want cool cold weather durable flannel type gear, I'm open to somebody new being in the conversation. If it looks awesome and it feels right in my hand, yeah, I will give that a go. But if I want stuff for working out, running, playing tennis, I already have that on lockdown. And you'd have to be pretty precise with your marketing to get me to believe that your thing is better than the trusted products I use for working out exercise stuff. And I cannot imagine myself putting on gear that says musk ox when I know that I'm going to play tennis in 95 degree weather, that I'm going to go through a gallon of fluids while I do so. I want something that has cool in the name. I want something that sounds like it was built for that activity, whereas musk ox just sounds like it was built for the exact opposite of the activity. And even if they made a really good product, you can still tell by the name they picked. This isn't really what they care about. Yeah, this tennis gear isn't really what they're going for. I just would never buy it. But the other stuff that could get into my rotation. It's interesting how strong a brand is. A brand kind of super seeds the product itself at times. And I was just super thrilled that Brad would take the time to even talk to us about this stuff. How about that? I don't know if I could do that that well. If I went on somebody else's show and they're like, I would want to talk about what you make or what you do. We want to talk about your thought process with your brand and what about it is working and what doesn't. And we want to criticize it. I mean, criticize sounds harsh, but we want to poke at it. I don't think I could do it as well as he just did it. Yeah, it was like next level honesty. For me personally, I found it to be really, really valuable because I'm able to look at his thought process and turn that around on myself and be like, oh, I'm not thinking through what's smarter every day that the brand is like to the level that he's thinking through Muscox. Like, I guess I don't have a physical product that I sell. But I think it's useful to think about what happens in someone else's mind when you say the name of the thing you do, even if you haven't even put something in their hands. I mean, that's a valuable exercise. Well, it comes back to the thing we were talking about the very beginning of our conversation. Branding is a story. And that's why I don't remember how long ago it was, buddy. Like four or five years ago now, you and I were talking about the idea of a personal brand and how whether we mean to or not everyone is building a personal brand on some level as a means of staying sane, of finding meaning and relevance and some sense of uniqueness in a world where increasingly you can connect with everybody else on the planet. And we all have a lot in common. I don't think it's a coincidence at all that we're seeing more really dynamic, really unique expressions of self that nobody has done in the past. And I think the reason for that is we do want to occupy our own real estate as individuals. And when you make a formal brand that you're trying to invite other people into the story, I think it's getting more and more difficult to find that little space where the story is unique, but not so dang weird that it's unappealing. And I think they're on to something with the logo, with the mascot, with the name Muscox. It's cool. It's a niche name that should target its strength and its strength is stuff that makes you feel like you want to be warmer than what you feel right now. And they make really reliable stuff that does that. You lean into that. It works. You venture away from that story that makes them them. I think it might get weird. Yeah. And one thing I want to bring up, I don't know, this might be off topic, might not, but I think the secret to having a good brand is for it to be general enough that everybody is invited in, but specific enough that people want to jump on board. And I think one thing I'm seeing brands do a lot lately that kind of goes against that is they're getting political. Like brands are starting to, I saw one tweet. It's like, well, I saw the latest news, but I don't know how I feel about it yet because I need to wait to see how my favorite mustard brand weighs in on it. I also saw that tweet. And I mean, a lot of times you type LOL, but very rarely do you mean LOL. I meant LOL after reading that tweet. Yeah. I don't engage with anything like that. And that's something I try to do with Smarter Every Day is I just stay a mile away from all the political stuff. I don't care what you as a brand, what your position is on XYZ. I just care if you make a good garage door opener. I just care if your wrenches are good. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, that really is what I want. I know what the counterstatement is to that, which would be, well, if something's super obviously right or wrong, it's incumbent on a brand, a company on anyone to take a stand. But the thing is that isn't why brands exist. I saw something at a chain Mongolian place that I like. And the sign on the door said, our customer's safety is our number one priority. And I was like, well, no, if it was, you'd build safety products or you would just close your store forever and never interact with anyone. It's not your number one priority. It's your important priority along with, well, also we'd like to have a business and make money and provide food that people enjoy eating and an environment that people enjoy. But there's this feeling that you need to signal that you think the right things and that your priorities are somehow in line with what they ought to be when the reality is that businesses are supposed to make money. And if they don't make money, they no longer exist. And then there's no conversation to be had about whoever runs their Twitter accounts opinion anyway. At some level, I think we just need to candidly admit that if there is a brand, if there is a company, they would like to earn dollars. And if they don't, it's all a moot point. Yeah. It's just something I see brands doing. I think it's just a waste of energy and it actually ends up alienating people from your products. I'm looking forward to keeping up with Muskox in the future to see exactly where they go with a brand and what they do. There's another step. Once you get the product in your hand, you can feel like what the product feels like. And that's also a part of the brand. So I'm going to do that too. And that's not an ad. That's just me saying what I'm going to do. Yeah. And selfishly, I want to get some of their stuff so I can compare notes with what I heard Brad say. And I want to get some of their stuff so that now I know what to look for in terms of the human part of the thing that went into it. This is a part of his soul, a part of what he is nurturing is something that he wants to win. The better I understand how his process works and how that physically manifests as a product, the better I can do it that the next time I take a run at building a thing. Yeah. Well, this is awesome. I think we don't do this very often, but I would actually like to see what the feedback is from other people on this because brand hits people differently. And I would like to know what people think about this. So all the various ways to reach out to us, I would like to know what you think about brands and this particular brand and what you thought, what are they doing right? What are they doing wrong? It's a fun thought exercise. So yeah, hit us up. I'd love to see that. And maybe next time we have Brad on, we'll bring a little bit of that feedback back to him as well. See what he thinks of it. Oh, yeah. That'd be cool. Yeah. I'll check you out in the, the patreon threads, patreon.com slash notom questions also Twitter, all the other places. So sweet. Thanks for this man. I enjoyed it.
