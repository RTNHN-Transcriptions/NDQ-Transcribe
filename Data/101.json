Okay. This is a series of photos of figure skaters, figure skaters spaces while they're doing the little super spin. That's the one that gets me the one where his eyes is like looking his eyes in the direction that he's spinning and it looks like it's like a Jack in the box. That one right there. That one right there. The one that looks demonic with the eyes rolled back into the head. There's something funny about the human body going beyond its physical limit, but I don't know. There you go. If you need if you need joy in your life, go look up figure skaters while spinning photos of that. How are you doing, man? I'm doing super. Have I told you that this is what my sister did? This was her growing up sport. Figure Skate. I played baseball in the. Yeah, I played baseball and some other stuff. Kendra was a figure skater. Still pretty dang good at it too. Really? Because she do a triple sau cow. If she could do a triple, I think a sau cow would be the jump because I think that's the first triple you learn. That are a triple toe loop. I don't remember which one is easier. Like, I don't know. She would be right on the edge. I mean, she had all of her doubles down. Yeah, but it's pretty fun when you grow up doing the figure skating thing, or at least when it's the 80s or 90s. You have an axle party and it's like the right of passage for each young figure skater is the day you land your first axle. This sounds like something that Sabaton people would attend. Like an axle. It sounds like a death metal kind of. Hey, you go into the axle party. Mop, mop, mop. Yeah, absolutely. She did this one routine to. Was it deemed from Spy Hunter? debugger is secret agent, man. It's saying do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. You know that one? Yeah. She went to that and she had like this little, uh, little spy costume with all black and everything. And back then you could make gun gestures at a figure skating rink and people would think that was pretty cool. So she did that. And then she did one to the Indiana Jones theme, which is really cool. Like all the way from the beginning with the bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. And then it just builds into something cooler. She's really good. I loved going to her events and watching her do the skating thing. You know, what's crazy about that is I don't know if this is how it still works, but did you know that there is a part of figure skating called? I think it's called patch. No, like patch, like for blue jeans when you tear them or something. Yeah. I think it's what it's called. I could be wrong. I'm not a figure skater, obviously, but it's this thing where they get out like a compass, like an ice compass and they put a spike in the middle of the ice. And then they've got like a little blade on the end of a long arm. They spin that around and make a couple of circles or patterns. And then what you would have to do is you would have to very carefully on one blade ride around whatever pattern they made and make your pivots at the right moment. And they would go and they would measure how close you are to the line, the pattern that they marked in the ice. And I remember them going out there with like a quarter or some calipers or something and they give you a score based on your technical ability to control your body measured by whether or not you could stay right on this line in all these different goofy patterns. I think it was called patch. So it's like precision ice skating. Very slow, very controlled. And then it would be part of your score. So if you would go to an event, I don't even know what you call them. You go to the event and everybody would be out there doing their patch thing, their technical thing. And nobody really watched because it's crazy slow and boring. And then you just get the score and then your short program and your long program would also count and contribute to your general score. And then the winner of the event, I think, was decided after all three of those programs were done. But you could get to a place where you did so well on patch and so well on your short program that your long program, like you'd have to really screw it up not to still win. Or there's doesn't matter how great you do. There's no way for you to get back into it because you got like two quarter widths off on your technical thing at the beginning that nobody cares about. So I don't know if it's still like that at all, but I remember going to these events and it was really, really fun. A lot of energy in the arena and rooting for my sister to kill it and she did a great job. That's awesome. That's fun. Yeah, I have a lot of a lot of memories watching my sister do sports. My sister actually did a an Instagram live thing last night. She got her guitar back out and she was playing guitar with her friend Rachel. They were playing. That was cool. Where were they playing? All kinds of stuff. Tons of different songs that I don't know the names to, but I know the songs. It was great. Like fun songs, happy songs are like songs that everything dudes who are trying to hook up with girls that can't play around campfires like run away train. Like well, they had their 2009 playlist from when they used to go play in bars and test. And so they'd pull the two. So they're legit. Yeah, it was good. It was fun. And so I enjoyed watching it. Rachel's mom was in there and she's like, I'm crying. You know, she was sleeping texts or she's even little comments in the Instagram feed like I'm crying right now. Beth, are you crying? You know, and these like moms are all talking and I just, I would just say things like LOL. And another guy was like, it happens, man. You know, sometimes ladies cry when people sing well. It's just so silly. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, that's not my thing. Did you and your sister fight growing up? You get along pretty well. Oh, of course we fought. I don't know. It just depends. We went in phases. It's the law of undulation. So at times I would fight with my sister. And at other times we would be like real good buddies. And so it's fun. We're buddies now. I've got two sisters and a brother and we're buddies. Did you stick up for all the time, even if you were in the part of the undulation where you were fighting? You know, we were so far apart. All of my siblings are four years and three months apart or three years and four months apart. I can't remember. And we were just far enough out of one person's social sphere to not completely be in the other social sphere. But we were like on the periphery. And so there was really no need. I mean, my goodness, they don't need help sticking up for themselves. They're pretty awesome. It's interesting how the siblings, particularly the siblings of the opposite sex can hold up a mirror to your soul. My sister is still real good for that. We hung out here a little while back there, a little Christmas thing together. And she doesn't even have to say anything. She just knows I'm a fraud. Don't be sense forever. She sees through all of my bull crap. And I'd like to think that maybe I see through her as she doesn't have as much as I do. And yeah, I mean, you know somebody that long and you've been there for every ounce of their development as a human as they explore the world and figure out rather rudimentary things like walking and talking. And they've seen the scene the same in you. It's just it's a mirror to the soul. No, nobody else, not even Adam has known me that long in that context. And so it just, yeah, I mean, I love her on the merits of her being a wonderful human. And I just love her, but I also love her on the merits of she sees things about me that I could hide from the rest of the world. Oh, absolutely. She knows my little shams and she calls me on it without even saying words. Oh, absolutely. My siblings, at times, I'm like, there's nothing I could ever do to make you happy as there. I could never impress you or anything like that. Could I? Like nothing matters. It's just like you're always going to be a loser. Destin. That's just the way it is. So in a good way, in a good way. I don't know. I don't know if it's in a good way. OK, well, well, for us, it's in a good way. No, it's interesting because we're doing the holiday thing and you know, you see family or at least communicate with family this year. And it's one of those times everybody dreads, but also everybody dreads because it's a mirror to your soul. You know, you're going to push each other's buttons. You know, conversations are going to come up about the world and politics and. Oh my goodness. In our country, especially holiday season with extended family during an election. Mercy me, that's going to be an adventure, but it's also this beautiful built in thing to how we do life where every year the mirror gets held up to your soul for better, for worse, and you endure that and you grow from it and maybe you return the favor to others. And I know you and I were talking this week. I think we both had a conversation with our mutual friend, George, about a mirror to the soul moment that did not involve the sibling. Yeah. And would you still be down with probing into that a bit further? Absolutely. Yeah. I've contacted George and asked him if he is willing to hop on and he said he is. So you want me to just try to patch him in here? Yes. This is a humbling story and I love it. Let's let's do it. This episode of Notum Questions is sponsored by Hello Fresh and Matt, I have something interesting to report here. I'm ready. We have tried a new recipe from Hello Fresh that we haven't had before and it's pretty dang good. It's up there with steak and sass. So I'm going to. Yeah, I know. It's pretty impressive. I don't know how to say it though. It's called Bovette steak in a mushroom sauce. B-A-V-E-T-T-E steak in a mushroom sauce. It comes with carrots, roasted carrots and caramelized onion mashed potatoes. And dude, it was so amazing. I took a picture of the recipe and just keep it on my phone and look at it ever once in a while. It's awesome. Wasn't the kind of thing where you make the displays or the sauce or something and then each bite of steak, cut it and then you put the part that you cut, you put it face down into the sauce and swing it around in the figure eight shape. I mean, you eat it with the fresh sauce used by each time. You know the one. Well, I think why why it was so good is the steak had this mushroom sauce that was so good. And so you dip the steak in that, but the mashed potatoes also had these caramelized onions on them. Dude, it was just phenomenal. I also cheated. No, my wife made it, but I cheated a little bit and I've put some of the mushroom sauce on the potatoes as well. You can't do that. It was good. I did. I did. It was amazing. I think the product just speaks for itself. It's amazing food that you can make at your house.

Good to see you guys talk to you. OK, so we had this. We each had a conversation with you this week and turns out we were we both had independent mind blowing experiences with this phone conversation. It was something really. So yeah, actually, absolutely. Would you agree? I would agree. Yeah, we both called each other to talk to each other about the story you told us. No, you didn't. I told my spouse and yeah, it's about a lot, man. It was that I thought about a lot too, but I didn't realize that it had an effect beyond that. You said they needed to hear this. I needed to hear this like right now. And then you hung up. I was like, all right, I guess that's good. Great. OK, so I was quite that emphatic, but I was excited about it, too. So for the third chair, George, Matt, what I would prefer, hold on, George, just sidebar with Matt, reverse second earmuffs. So Matt, what I think we do is we just let George just tell the story as if we're hearing it for the first time. What are you thinking? Yes. OK, and should we pretend? I pretend like it's the first time hearing it. Yeah. I'm really good pretender. No, I think we just don't interrupt him. We just let him go. I don't want to interrupt him. OK, cool. Let's do it. I have no interest. I want I want this to be full impact for everyone. Hey, George, we're back. We're back, George. Hi, I didn't hear any of that. So good. So what happened? Just start at the beginning. Tell us everything that happened, like the mental framework where you were mentally when it happened and all that stuff. Just go for it. OK, the story. Basically, I don't remember what day love the week it was, but it was morning. I was going to Starbucks drive through to get my breakfast of Sufi egg bites, which I love there and orange juice. If they have it, I pulled into the drive through, got in line because there are a lot of people have similar needs and there is a Range Rover in front of me, which was fine. There's a guy, the windows down guy smoking. I just noticed it. There was no judgment. There was just like, OK, but then basically kind of the story started or the interaction started for me when he threw out, he finished, I guess, smoking the cigarette and threw the butt out the window into the parking lot. And I didn't react well to that. I just found myself angry and self righteous and I was more of a feeling than an intellectual and I found myself reaching for the door, grab the handle, started to open the door with the intent of going and grabbing the butt off the ground and throwing it into back through the window because the window was down. And that just seemed like the right thing to do in that first moment. But then I stopped myself for a couple of reasons. One was that I felt like not a smart thing to do. I've blocked this guy in. He has nowhere to go. So like I'm stepping into a like, it's not like getting out of a car. The other times I've almost done it. I couldn't, I didn't catch the people fast enough. Like it was at a stoplight or your next to them and you see him do it and then they speed off. But even if I had done it, they would have gotten away. This I felt like he stuck. If I do this, it's like confrontation city and I don't necessarily have control over it. So from kind of just a wisdom standpoint, I felt like this could go south. And that's probably not smart. I don't. And I also felt like I know, I know about myself that like people don't sit next to me. If there's an empty seat on a plane, people just don't sit next to me. Like I don't know why. I think I've inferred that I probably am not the friendliest person, looking person. And so I know that like that might be an overreaction, like that might be frightening. And that's not really what I wanted to do. And so I was still very angry. I stopped myself and I also that really the third reason and probably the most important reason is I felt like I should be seeing this guy as a child of God. That felt like from a kind of a religious standpoint would be most important for me to be doing. And I really was just, it would feel really good to go throw the cigarette back in the car. But ultimately that is not what was best for me in the moment, like what I needed to do. And so I stopped myself. We kind of inch forward where the moment kind of passed where I could do it, but I still really ticked off and the Range Rover part ticked me off because this is, I don't know how expensive those are, but I know they're ridiculously expensive cars. And so it was very easy for me in my mind to go this rich, entitled guy. And I created this character in my head that I didn't. And stop. Is this too long? Should I like to have been abbreviated? No, no, this is perfect. No. This is how I received this story. This is how I work a story passed along. Okay. So I attached like the Range Rover thing just ticked me off and I just really didn't like this guy. And I kind of kept wrestling with this. And I was like, well, no, this is a guy. This is a child of God. There's somebody made ultimately in the image of like this of God like myself. And I shouldn't be, I just didn't like being that mad and assuming these things, but I felt was feeling these feelings of self righteousness, which I through of experience I found rarely lead me anywhere good. So I was kind of combating that and fighting that. And then, um, and I was trying to think of, well, why would he do that? What is his thought process? Why, why is he doing that? And I thought, well, and I slowly as I kind of move forward in the line, which we had a number of cars to get there, my thought process, like my imagine, I kind of calmed down and the imagination I had or my, my imagining of the conversation we would have slowly changed from me throwing the butt back into his car. It eventually evolved to questioning him as to why he did that. What did he expect to happen to that butt? Like, was that maybe he was thinking this will provide a job for somebody, you know, and that, that's be surprising, but interesting. And I was like, what, what would be the conversation that would move this guy forward rather than just create a, like slant, like it's some collision of two people in the world and, um, like what, what would help this guy not do it again? So I got to that point. And then I also decided that as soon as I get up to the front, I'm going to ask, I could see who is, you know, getting his food. And I was next and, and I was like, I'm going to ask the woman who's doing at Starbucks. I'm going to ask if he seemed like a nice person. And I felt like she'd probably say yes, but if not, then I was like, okay, well, he's really got some challenges and I could just leave it at that. But if she thinks he's a nice person, then it goes to show that there could be something different there that I saw one side of it and there's something else. So you actually wanted to ask that question. Like you decided to ask that was my question. As soon as I pull, I'm pulling up. And that was the question that I felt like I needed to talk to somebody about it. And I felt like I'm going to talk to her about it and that's going to make me in one way or another, I'll get more data and more information. And then I can at least express myself about what I'm feeling right now to her who's had an interaction with him and that'll change that'll do something. But I was no longer, I was still ticked off, but I was not as ticked off. And so I got up to the window. He pulls away. I get up to the window. And before I can ask my question, which I'm really excited to ask, she says, Hey, the guy in front of you paid for your food. I was like, I literally was like, what? And she said, Oh, he, the guy in front of you paid for your food. And I said, why? And she said, well, he said it's that season and we should be doing stuff like that. And I started laughing. Like I just immediately the irony of this, like just hit me in the face. And I said, well, that's hilarious because I'm so ticked off at that guy or I was so ticked off at that guy because he threw his cigarette butt out in the, in the parking lot. And she kind of was like, Oh, didn't really, you know, react to that. It just was kind of like, okay. And then I was like, well, I'll pay for the people behind me then. And so I paid for the people behind me and I got my food and I drove away. And I was looking to see if by chance he was still around when I drove away, but I didn't see him because I would have if I could have stopped and said, thank you. I and have a connection. I don't know. I was looking for it, but I didn't see it. It's funny because I've thought about that a lot as over the, you know, I think I immediately within like the half hour called both of you. But then I, I've kind of slowly processed it more as time has gone. We're with it now. Uh, basically it immediately hit me with like, Oh, people aren't all like, you can't put people in just one category of kind of like bad or good. I mean, you just kind of have to, and that was kind of the like just, it made me laugh because it just was like, yeah, you don't know everything. You know, I've thought about it. And I think that I wrestle with is like he should not have thrown that cigarette out. Why? What do you want my food? What's what's wrong with? He shouldn't have thrown the cigarette out because that's destroying like those things don't go away. Like the filters staying around forever. They're going to be there. Dogs pick them up and eat them. Babies play with them. They're dirty. It's like, if you're going to smoke, whatever, but throw the butt away. Cause that's that we don't want a world where everybody just throws trash in the streets. Like if everybody does that with everything, I don't want to live in that world. And so I don't do it and I don't want other people to do it. And I don't, I don't, it's like, so he shouldn't do that because it was a selfish and that's a selfish act. He didn't want to get his, you know, pretty card dirty and I get that. So he threw it out, but it's that's not good enough. But the fact that he was celebrating the holidays with giving makes me go, okay, there's something to work with there. Now, you know, I don't know whether and that that's the thing I've been thinking about. If someone's 10% good and 90% bad, if you could reduce it to that kind of ratio, I think I want to be a person who's looking at that 10% and trying to work with it and see if we can get it up. And I certainly don't want to be someone who's making that 10%, push it down to 9% in the interactions that I have. That's something that I think that I've kind of the most that I've processed with it. It's very easy right now, or you could probably all, you know, all time. It's very easy to be self-righteous in terms of dealing with him and what I learned exactly from him, it's about that. It comes down to say it tritely. It's like looking for the good in people, but I think it's, it's deeper than that. It's having a conscious patience with the bad that you deal with. And then for me, it was also, I also go like, good job for like as a dude, you know, if I had called you guys and said, guys, I threw the butt of a guy through his cigarette back in his Range Rover, however that goes, he would have been a great story. And you guys probably would have had me. I don't know. No, no, no, I wouldn't have. I would have been like, well, normally when you call me and we talk about things, like, well, you we talk about things. I'm like, and that guy's got his head screwed on straight. I've got a real humble take on things. He pushes me on things. That would have been one of the few times I would have been like, now what now? So you hurled someone's flaming litter back into their luxury car. No, I think of another way to hold on. Hold on. I've actually done this. I was the litter on fire, Dustin Sandlin. No. So it was it. Okay, there's a difference. Pie pie's chicken. And I was like, man, well, I'm going to eat some chicken. And I was outside eating at the little picnic area. And this person pulled up to a red light and they just rolled down the window and just threw the paper out the window and they were stuck at a red light. So I didn't have the ability to empathize, to realize they were stuck. Like you did, George, because you're, I think empathy is your superpower. But I walked up, picked up the paper because it was close to the picnic table and I tapped on the glass and they rolled the glass. I didn't show them the paper when I tapped on the glass. They tapped on the glass and then I picked up the paper and I said, Hey, you dropped this. Nice. And I handed it back to them. I didn't throw it in there. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. And then they took it back. And so I just made it awkward is all I did. I was wanting that back. You know, that's nice. That was nicer though. That yeah, you're right. That was, but that was a nicer version of what I was coming with. There's some moral differences here though. In terms of degree, I mean, again, one of those two items is on fire. No, totally. I guess it's a very small thing. I mean, the big thing, a trash, like I don't object to that story. There's something about the flavor of your story. If you've been like, I threw a cigarette butt back in a window at a guy. And I'm like, Oh, you trying to get killed? What's the plan? What are you trying to get? That was really the thing like that could get me killed, but it wasn't the right thing to do. I know that and I knew that and that's why I didn't do it. I knew this is not the right thing to do, even though I have the perfect opportunity and it's a guy in a ridiculously expensive car and it'll feel really good. I'll tell you what, though. Yeah, somehow I feel like Dustin did do the right thing in his. I understand this might make me a hypocrite. I don't like him more than I like you. I think you're both wonderful. And it's okay if you do. That seemed good. That seems weird. I agree. I have two things on my mind and I think they both connect. I just want to ask you a couple of questions about it. Is that cool? Do it. OK, thing number one, this episode of the podcast is brought to the third chair by Raycon. Raycon makes earbuds that we both love. We'll talk more about that in a minute. Thing number two, you're doing this forest gump 500 thing that involves running on purpose. 500 miles in the next year. Am I understanding that correctly? You are. And here's the way this came about. I've got a buddy in Atlanta. He ran a thousand miles last year and he likes to remain anonymous online. He doesn't want attention or anything like that. But he ran it with an organization called Black Men Run. And we've been friends since college and we go back and forth all the time. And it was amazing to watch his progress bar last year. He would post just every week or so. He would post a little progress bar of his way towards a thousand miles. And that was so encouraging. And I thought to myself, you know, I don't have a goal like that. That is a long duration. You know, I'm going to do this thing, but it requires constantly coming back and checking in with my own goal and doing it. And then some type of progress bar. And I wanted that to be honest. But when I started doing the math, I was like, you know, a thousand miles in a year. That's like three miles a day or something like that. That's a little too much for me. That's like too invasive into my time. And the more I thought about it, I was like, you know, 500 is a is a reasonable goal. You could catch up if you got behind. You know what I mean? Yeah. I thought I was thinking it would be really easy to get behind at 2.8 or whatever miles per day. That would break my psyche really quickly. You're looking at less than one of the half a day with this thing. That's too. I can do a three mile run. And so even if you did a three mile run, like every other day, you're still going to hit it. But I wanted, I didn't want it to be like just for people who are comfortable going out there and running because running is hard. Well, or if you do a 500 mile run one day, that's a great point. I didn't think about that, Matt, mostly because I'm not physically able to do that. Yeah. This is kind of how I structured it. I didn't want it to be focused on Destin. I wanted to be focused on something, you know, silly. So I thought about people that motivated other people to run. And I came up with Forrest Gump, you know, from that day on. If I was going somewhere, I was running. So I love that. I love that movie so much. Anyway, so I thought I'll just name it something ambiguous and weird. And, you know, I can post Forrest Gump gifs on the internet or maybe not or whatever. And so named it. Four scum 500. Right. Yeah, it's ridiculous. So I just created an Instagram account that I could just post my progress bar, like my buddy did. That's really all that's there for. Just to say, Hey, we're doing this thing. Are you entering you out to give people a mental option? And then I noticed that someone created a group on Strava. It's not a challenge, which I wish they had set it up as a challenge, but they were, you know, their heart was in the right place. They set up a group called the Forrest Gump 500 has over 60,000 members right now. Six, six zero comma zero zero zero. Well, yeah, exactly. So my goal was for this thing to outgrow me. And I tried to brand it as such and it happened. So wait, 50,000. I haven't told you a million miles, right? I don't know. That's math. I haven't thought about that. All I know is that I have my own personal app. And I'm currently using Nike Run Club, but there are other options. And I'm going to do 500 miles. And I'm just going to I'm going to post my progress as I go. And other people are doing the same. There's no like currently there's no place to check in or anything like that. I might make something in the future. But right now I'm going to send you the link right now so they can see that I'm not making this up. Um, 66,283. That's nuts. I'm like willing to run. I do not own that group. I'm not in control of it or whatever. Yeah. Anyway. So that's it. But you were saying Raycon, we should we should talk about Raycon real quick. Well, no, you can see what I'm doing here. I'm connecting two dots about what your year is going to look like because. I use my Raycons on the workout side for tennis. I go and hit on the ball machine. Yeah. Have you ever seen a tennis ball machine or hit on one of those? No, I've always wanted to. It reminds me of the Canon and American gladiators. So I've always wanted to check it out. It's basically the idea. Yeah. I mean, the way you hit on the ball machine is you go up to it, perfectly in low light, you know, like, Hey, what's up? No, I'm kidding. That's a different expression that hit on you turn the thing on it. She's tennis ball that you and then you act so kind of falls with the racket. Yeah, you try to hit him in. I was really good. I was one of the better things I've ever said ever period. Not. So yeah, I don't know. It's like an hour, hour and a half, but it's not linear. You don't know what you're going to get. You put the ball machine to random and you kind of run back and forth. Then that activates my brain. And so I've been putting on music more while I do that, you know, pump up stuff. When I run, it doesn't work. At one, it's not a good runner. It's not my strong suit anyway, but I need the, I need the mental brain space. So question for you. Do you listen to music or do you listen to talking and ideas and thinking when you do these 500 miles worth of rounds? I listened to thinking that stretches me. So right now I'm listening to a 30 hour audio book called the making of the atomic bomb. I listen to books typically, like super deep, thinky books that are beyond my current knowledge base. And because I'm stretching myself physically, I'm stretching myself mentally. That's what I enjoy. So, but, but I use Raycon's when I do that. I use a combination depending on the day of the everyday E25 earbuds or the E55, the performer. I use either one of these because I have two. One thing I like about the Raycon's is you can just pop them out really easy. There's also a little button on there. You can just pause what you're doing. So if I'm passing some old ladies with little dogs or something and I don't want them to think that I'm being rude, I'll just pause it and say, Hey, how's it going? And then keep going. One thing you always have to think about when you're running on a street, for example, is you need to think about your surroundings. So I try not to get too engrossed in the book where I can't see like traffic and so I always try to remain aware of what's around me. And the good thing is you can just pop one of them out and just listen to everything around you with one ear and just listen to your audiobook with the other. So I would highly encourage you to consider Raycons. These things are about half the price of other premium wireless earbud brands and they sound just as amazing. So don't we have some kind of promo code or something, Matt? Yes, we do. If you go to buy Raycon.com slash NDQ, you get 15% off your order. You get 15% off whatever you're getting. That's awesome. Yeah, I like them. I've got three pairs of Raycons. I have two everyday E25s and one performer E55 and they're all functioning well and I'm happy with them. I have field pass data on the durability of the Raycons. Oh, because I was at the Pena Center. I was there alone. It's probably about nine 30 at night. They got four chords and there's just one guy in there and I'm listening to 80s pump up music, like invincible by Pat Benatar. And I was like, all right, now I'm going to work on some stuff at the net where I fire the rocket balls at me. And so I turn it on and you have to run around the net to the other side. And I'm just getting set up and here comes the first one. I just wasn't set up quite or ready for it. And I had it on rocket ball setting. I just got my racket into position while Pat Benatar is singing about how we will be invincible. And it spun the edge of the racket and went straight into my ear. Drilled me in my way. The racket. The racket in the ear, the ball hit you in the ear. Only slightly deflected. I don't know how bad that is. It's like 90. So fast. Things like a happy Gilmore in the batting cage and drills me. And of course, you know, what's the first thing you do when you get hit in the face? You look to see if anybody saw it. What you do, what I meant to, we will be invincible. I'm fine. I'm fine. And I'm like, you know, my head's kind of ringing. And I just stepped out and let it continue to shoot against the ball. Shooting balls against the wall while you're like licking your wounds. Did it hit you in the right? Con right in the right. He's straight in the Raycon. It fell out. Oh, yeah. It just rolled out. So now I know it kind of falls. We'll not jam a Raycon ear, but straight into your brain. Dude, getting hit in the right. That's the worst. Stop on a man. So yeah, it fell out and, you know, my head hurt and I was embarrassed in front of nobody. They have cameras there. I know somebody's going to see it someday. Oh, God. I have to you have to get me that footage. I'm sweating. I remember what day I was there. It's weird. These are confusing times. And so I'm like, oh, my ray concert. So I went and I found it laying there on the court and I put it back in. And I was like, oh, everything's absolutely fine. And my pump up music was there. Was it like Velma from a Scooby-Doo looking for her glasses? My Raycon. I've got to run my Raycon. Oh, it was bad. OK, hey, they took it. So that's a W. That's good. Awesome. What was it that performer or the or the everyday? That was the everyday. Awesome. I like that you tell stories about yourself getting hurt. Thank you. I'm here to help. OK, so by Raycon.com slash NDQ, you get 15% off your order. We use these things all the time. We like them and when you support the sponsor, you support the program. And we really appreciate that. Absolutely. A nice job on the fourth come 500 thing, dude. That's pretty awesome. I have other confidence that you will get in all 500 miles. And I'm glad that you have earbuds that you like that work well to get you through all 500. Yeah, I appreciate it, man. Thank you very much. Cool. Thanks to Raycon and thanks to all of you for listening and supporting sponsor. OK, hitting the Raycon. I can't hear where the right. Freaking hurt. Was the music still going? Oh, yeah, in the one ear, but it like you know, when you get a little bit, a little ways away from sound and starts to sound all flat. What I'm thinking about right now is this first person shooter or war, like movies where, you know, the bomb goes off right there and everything's ringing like and the music you're listening to in the other ear is like off in the distance and muffles. You stand up both hands go to your forehead. You're trying to regain your faculties as you look for your friends. Oh, no, the money is you're not wrong. This brings me joy. Thank you. I want to understand without the payoff at the end of the story where the guy pays for your stuff and you're sitting there. First of all, you're an incredibly selfless person. I know you in real life and just the fact that you would take the time to think that through and learn something about yourself. You're like, Hey, I am judging people that I shouldn't. Like that's not something that people do and you do that all the time. So that was good for me to realize that sometimes I snap to judgment. And I don't think about it like you do. And the fact that you a you recognized it and be you called me to more or less confess it to me, you know, those things made me better. But what is the thing that you took from this whole thing? Like what is the lesson and what are you going to change moving forward? Honestly, I think it has to do with it's weird. I think in a lot of ways it comes down to as a dude, you don't want to be afraid of things. You want to do the right thing. And I, you know, and this may be just me wrestling with my own sense of masculinity and being a man and what that means. This definitely like I just, yeah, I could see. I mean, there are a lot of women who actually I could see. I have some ants who I could see totally doing this. But it was like, I didn't want to be afraid of confronting someone, but it's like, I think it's thinking in terms of that thing, that self righteous thing of kind of like animal courage for lack of a better word that it's moral courage. Like I guess that's the thing is that really laying into the moral courage rather than the animal courage is something that is I think important. And the moral courage of being able to do the right thing in the face of maybe looking weak or not being liked or the thing that will kind of not give immediate gratification where the animal courage is that, you know, wants to just fight, confront, attack or defend. And I'm just finding that in my own kind of thought process, my own, I don't know what they're calling instincts or not, but my own mind thought that that animal instinct, I don't know. It's not real helpful. Look. It doesn't solve things long term. It doesn't make the world better. It doesn't play a long game. It doesn't think two steps ahead. It, you know, I don't want to, I don't know, because of maybe my dad and think it's like, I think of coming from and want to have come from a courageous, you know, a lot, but I'm realizing like that gentleness, the, like it's a different kind of courage. And I guess that's what I've been, I've been thinking about it. And it's like the courage to look at the 10%, the courage to turn the other cheek and be looking to then bring someone forward in there wherever they are, just try to move them up or wrong, whatever even that means. But kind of love them rather than that kind of more confrontational, like, dominate them. Maybe that's a way of, you know, I, yeah, it goes off into a long thing with why I think it goes into like how you raise kids, how you deal with people like there can be within manliness, this feeling of like I'm going to dominate this situation. And I'm learning that yielding, whether it's kind of in a Christian or religious sense, spiritual sense, just yielding to something bigger often is so important. And I'm just learning that so much of like success is in yielding, not dominating. I don't know if any of that made sense, but that's kind of what I'm thinking about. I can't help it, Dustin. I'm going to do it. I got a JPM, the thing. So you just threw like five battleship darts all around the boat of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew, chapter five. But it's, I mean, all of those, I turn the other cheek. That's from the Sermon on the Mount. Yeah. All of this stuff that you're talking about is reflective of that biggest block of Jesus moral philosophy, Jesus, religious thought is right there from Matthew five to Matthew seven and, and in there, like the opening for a of, yep, those are the sounds of Bible pages turning because I have that on my desk. Cause what I do, the opening for is the very famous B attitudes. Blessed are the foreign spirit, blessed are those who mourn. And then the third beat attitude is blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth. And people hear that and meek sounds like, you know, blessed are the really beat down pathetic people who don't have any options anyway. They're so pathetic and weak and lowly that in Jesus upside down kingdom, they'll be blessed and things will be better for them. But it's more complex than that. As you guys both know, I'm telling you something, you know, I see it on your faces, but that the term meek is really multi layered. And the idea is restrained power. You have the option to go flick the cigarette back in the window and most people might pat you on the back for it, but you didn't because of this really complicated moral equation, this really complicated big picture view of yourself and others that you were trying to painstakingly game out in the drive through. And so what you ultimately chose to do was restrain power. And the idea is that though you could have found justification, you didn't and that restraint theoretically makes, I mean, made the world better in that situation, made you better and that guy better and drive through lady better and somebody will pick up the cigarette butt. Yeah. I don't like I hate littering, but it's going to be okay. And in the grand scheme of things, your calculation was one, excellent. Two, they just straight up being from a literary source. It's so in keeping with all the values you just articulated them. It's all, that's all Jesus moral philosophy that you were articulating there. And I guess why I like your story is that you, the way you told it to me just now, the way you told it to me when you called me on the phone, you're like, we need to talk now. It's like, I'm kind of doing something. You're like, no, I have a thing. I need to tell you now. And I was like, I want to listen now. Go. You told me the story and you walked me through the same journey you went on where I start without rage. And I'm like, I like where this is going. This is going to be one of those cool instant karma kind of moments where somebody does a thing that I hate littering infinitely selfish, got called out by somebody I respect morally and intellectually. I see where this is going and you weren't trying to whip me into an angry frenzy at this guy, but I felt vicarious power through you to right this wrong, right this injustice and straighten this jack wagging out. And I was so ready to high five and be excited about it. And then the story turned out the way it did. And I was immediately ashamed of my attitude of myself. I was embarrassed. I know I probably would actually done something stupid and not demonstrated the restraint. And so in terms of vicariously experiencing a story that walks me through a moral framework, that makes me think about a document and a religious character I theoretically am really invested in and care about a lot and then flipping the story on me to realize I'm the bad guy in the story. Like that's why I've thought about this story pretty much every day since you've told me the potent stuff, man. That's awesome. That's awesome. It's funny. I just thinking about the people behind me that chain could have gone on for who knows how long that's what I love is I know if I had done that's one of the things I really love is I know if I if I had confronted the guy that chain of giving would not have happened. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. And so I think about like, you know what? What if two cars behind me, who knows how long it went on? What if 20 cars behind me, there was somebody who was having a heck of a holiday day. We've lost people within our family to COVID. They're people struggling in a lot of ways. And so like, I know there are a lot of people struggling. We all know that. I just think about like, what if this is what they needed and like having somebody at start that simple act of like, Hey, the people in front of you paid for your thing. Could have been really lovely for somebody. And I go like that wouldn't have happened. I know that wouldn't have happened if I had confronted the guy. And that might have been crucial in some or not even crucial, just really nice for somebody. And I go that I'm glad I didn't screw it up. You know what is so profound about your story to me is I can think of very few times where I have imagined myself to be on the moral low ground. Like I always give myself the benefit of the doubt morally. And I always imagined myself to be on the right side of the moral equation. And what was so interesting about the story to me is, is that you demonstrated to me that you were on the wrong side of the moral equation. And that just opened up the possibility to me that maybe I'm morally wrong a lot more than I realize. And you know, I've had people in my life that love me and are not afraid to tell me the truth, say things to me like, hey, you're not always right. Just remember that. And I think a lot of what energizes the angry discourse that we have right now in society is the concept of, hey, I'm morally right. Therefore, I'm justified to do whatever I need to do in order to get my way. And what's so interesting about your story to me is just like Matt said, like it made me realize I'm the bad guy in the story, which is just this really interesting mental judo move, this moral judo move that I've never experienced before. Maybe I have, but I don't know. It just opened me up to the concept that I'm probably morally wrong a lot more than I realize. That's interesting. I did not think about that at all. I just thought it was a funny story like that my mental, you know, journey, what I went through, I thought was interesting. I feel like the moral map, one's moral journey can change as you go. There are things that are wrong for me to do that I morally cannot do that I feel like a couple of years ago, I could have done and I didn't really know better, but there are things that I've learned. And so once I kind of learned them, they become wrong for me to do. And so I think it's something where I always want to be looking at what I'm doing so that you go like, hey, have I grown? Have I outgrown this? I remember some things I did as a kid, like one silly example. The reason I'm pretty decent at shooting is because I used to be able to shoot dragonflies in the air with a BB gun on the wing. Yeah, they'd fly. Well, yeah, when they would fly, I could, you know, they would come down to light on a clothesline and as they would hover, as they would figure out where they were going to land, I could shoot them. I remember doing that in Gordo, Alabama in a summer. And now I like it's my favorite insect. I've come to appreciate the beauty and the, I mean, what's so interesting about dragonflies is they have a really interesting musculature that operates the wing. They're like one of the most complex dynamic flyers that exists. And once I just slowly started studying these things and understand the complexity of their eyes and they're just like this dominant predator in the skies, I just think back and I feel guilt about being the dragonfly slayer back in the, back in my childhood, knowing that I just could not do that today because it's just like unnecessarily just wrecking all kinds of beauty in the world around me. It's what I was doing without realizing it. So I matured and I changed for the better, I think. I did the same with an infestation of toads. My friend Adam and I, we, we got tasked with cleaning up the yard. We had a toad infestation in the churchyard. And so like our job was make the toads go away. It was plague-like. It was insane. They're just everywhere. One spring. I have no idea why. There were no instructions, just gross. Nobody wants to be around all those toads. I mean, the lawn looked like it was boiling. I got this idea and I only did it to one because I was horrified. We loaded one in a water balloon launcher and fired it through a chain link fence. And that will kill a toad. It worked. That toad got quartered and I mean, oh, you're, you're a kid. I don't know, 12, 13 years old. That's awesome. What have we done? And so you talk about moral journey. Yeah. Some people might hear that and be really put off by that. Like, no, morality is black and white. It's easy and it's obvious. You do the right thing. You don't do the wrong thing. But I don't know. Like it might be black and white, but maybe you haven't read that whole book yet. Maybe you have to feel some of the weight of destroying beauty but these experiences and your drive-through experience, not just for you, but for me as well. It helps round out that situational morality. All right. I got this basic stuff. It's black. It's white. Sure. But what's the equation in all these different situations is trickier. So for example, I'm guessing there are people sitting in the third or is it the fourth chair? If you're with us, I'm sorry to call it the third chair. There are people sitting in the third chair right now going, you know what? I'm not sure I necessarily agree with you three guys with your moral clarity on this. There are some who would say destruction of earth or for me on the more libertarian side of things like the disrespect to the property and time of others of littering. I mean, the shared space, littering wrecks a planet we all live on. So I like conservation and I don't like wrecking things. Whatever moral framework gets you to the point of saying, no, littering is really bad. Maybe there are some people listening, you're like, no, that was the chief wrong and doing whatever you needed to do to address it. Sort of like maybe physically harming the person. That would have been the right thing to do. And maybe there are people who are thinking you let them off too easy and they're not understanding the equation. But you were running a moral equation that you're explaining to us. There was very complex and in depth that had to do with your soul and his soul that just assumes that I don't know that cigarette bottle be picked up and we'll figure that out some other way. So even there, how we prioritize our moral goods and our moral bads is going to result in some really complex moral math that people are doing, but the fact that you cared about running the equation says a lot. I think that's awesome. Well, thank you. Why was it so important that the person was in a Range Rover? What did that bring to the equation? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's very looking at my own thought. I think that's a really important thing that I found a fence in the Range Rover. Like, that's not good. I'm not proud of that. I just see it as like... Did you view him as an other? Like, he was a repugnant cultural other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't afford that thing. Like, and you're driving around your Range Rover. I didn't care. It wasn't something that I immediately was like, I see the Range Rover. I don't care. I have friends who have Range Rover. Like, I know people have Range Rovers, but as soon as they were divided, I didn't like you. As soon as you did the cigarette butt thing, that Range Rover became a mark against you. Right or wrong, it did in my book. Like, if it was... If it had just been some other car that was... You know, I don't know. And I don't think it's good. I mean, but it definitely was like, yeah, you're rich and title. Like, I felt like because I see the Range Rover, I made a whole bunch of assumptions that I don't have any business making. It could have been... Who knows? But here's the interesting thing you don't realize about the equation is, because he was rich, paying for your food was actually a flex. 100%. That's a joke. I mean, it's a joke, man. I don't think so. No, it's not. It's totally true. And I think that's one of the things. It's like, well, did this guy just get to pay for like, throw money at a problem? You know, and he's buying my forgiveness? I've wrestled through this whole thing. Oh, I didn't even think about that. Yeah, like, does he just get to like, I don't think he cares about your forgiveness. So no, he doesn't know about it. He doesn't need it. He doesn't care about it. But for me, in my journey, I got what I needed. I needed to see something good about this person, because that's what I was... I felt like from a spiritual and religious standpoint, I am asked to do, and I felt like that was an answer to my need. It wasn't about him. It was very much like, this inner struggle you've just had was worth it. This was good. And good is coming because of it. It has nothing to do with that guy. I would say, like, if I really was, you know, for Matt, to what you're saying about the environmentalists who might find this to be really a moral offense, and so you figure out what to do, you know, like whatever... I guess I would say to that person who sees that as this deep moral offense, and that the person is wrong and short of violence, you really should do anything you can, it's like, well, what is it that would actually stop this guy from littering? And I would argue that confrontation is not it. Confrontation in a, put them down way is not it. Guiding that guy's thought to see that that hurts other people. That it bought, even just bothers other people, would lean on whatever moral which they do have. There's some generosity there, some wanting to give of what they have, even if it's a flex. Like, there's a desire to connect with people they don't know. They want to be a part of something great or good. And so there is something there to appeal to. There is some moral, beautiful human thing, a part of them, and if you can figure out a way to expand that, you have a much better chance of them not throwing out their cigarettes, and maybe not doing other things, rather than a self-righteous confrontation with them. If you can find the point of connection first, that's my thought. And so, and I've thought through this a lot, I don't say I'm right, and next week I may know, no, I've thought through it, I should have thrown the butt in the car. That's awesome, man. Thank you so much. Just remind me not to litter in front of you.
