This is like one of the better episode ideas, and I appreciate you coming up with it Well, golly. Thanks buddy. Yeah, I enjoy watching Ren's YouTube channel or the YouTube channel that he's a part of I've enjoyed it for a very long time I enjoyed meeting and hanging out with Ren at Thinkercan We've kind of stayed in touch since then and I saw something come across Well, I don't want to spoil everything But I saw something come across the Internet's here over the last year and I thought Ren is the guy to speak to this thing and involve special effects and pop culture and the future and Social stuff like this is the guy so yeah, I'm pretty amped about it too. Yeah So I mean just to let the cat out of the bag deep fakes, right? Yeah, the idea of being able to create a video that sells itself as being reality when it's certainly not reality That's a big pivotal thing. I think for the future Probably like half the people sitting in the third chair right now are like deep fakes Those are so much fun. They got a little apps on their phones. They kind of do something sort of like a deep fake There was a gigantic iconic pop culture moment in the Star Wars universe Here within roughly the last year or so that involved a deep fake that was amazing Like this is just gonna be fun to explore these special effects and the technology and then probably half of the third chair Or like deep fakes are very dangerous They open up all kinds of ethical problems and opportunities for nefarious things to happen And I would love it if we could talk with Ren about both sides of that. So so here's what's interesting about Ren He's one of these people that I've watched them from afar for a really long time But then I got to meet him and he's just as amazing in person as he was like, you know Everything I imagine what I think is so interesting about Ren is that he's an engineer like his brain works on an engineering level very technical Understands the science But he also has the ability to make things that are just beautiful and fun to watch and he understands story and how to connect with people Yes, dude. He's he's kind of off the charts. He's not normal No, he's got a freak skill set and Look, I can think of a hundred things that are completely screwed up and weird about you that need to be dealt with at some point But one of the few things that I think's great about you is that You're kind of the same way you two are sort of peas in a pod and that you're both engineers You both see the matrix and all the moving parts in ways that Normies like me don't but the thing that humanity's guys like me that we comfort ourselves with we're like Oh, well, we bring some to the table too. We understand narrative and story and people you're also both really good at that And so he's he's one of few people I've ever met who has a similar skill set to you in that regard So I'm pretty excited to see what it's like when the two of you're in a room together Well, thank you for saying nice things, but I am excited to talk to Ren and Think about that think about the dozens of mean things that I'm withholding but that I'll tell you later No, I I think this is a really interesting Venn diagram moment because we've got like there's philosophical Consequences to the idea of making these fake videos about people and I don't know there's a lot here I'm just excited to get rid online. What do you think? Yeah? Oh, well, let's just let's just queue it up We're gonna get too far down the rabbit hole without the actual expert in the room if we keep going Hey, he's here Matt. This is Ren. Hey sweet So Ren, how do you how do you say your last name? Weichmann. Yeah close Weichmann like a hard K. Yeah, like Where are you from originally Ren? I kind of grew up all over but I consider myself from the Northwest so like Oregon and whatnot Seattle, etc That's awesome. So did you grow up in you just keep it nebulous nebulous? I mean I I lived in Louisiana I lived in Norway. I lived in Vietnam And now I've been in LA for so long that I have to say that I'm from LA So you just packed up your things with a stick and a handkerchief and made your way from Vietnam to Southern California to chase your fortunes across the sea. No, I had two handkerchiefs. It was fine There is a story about you just going to LA and where did you go to LA from from Portland, Oregon? Why did you do that? To become a youtuber I guess that was really the goal. Yeah, really it was from the beginning So I had graduated in 2011 from college with a degree in mechanical engineering and around like I don't know two months before graduating YouTube through on this competition called YouTube next up and over the course of the previous two or three years I'd started learning how to do visual effects as a hobby It was just a fun side thing. I had to kind of like pause it because it was starting to impact my grades but around that mark YouTube put on the YouTube next up competition and I became a finalist and it was the first time that actually sort of had my VFX hobby like Vindicated validated and realized wait, I think I can do something here I was already really enjoying it and I decided you know what I would much rather be creating videos and making films and stuff like that then Stress testing a bolt for the hundredth time. That's gonna go on the wing of an airplane sitting in a cubicle Yeah finite element analysis I did I did next up as well. Oh really you did yeah Yeah, it was so is a little a little different for me They called it the on the rise contest, but it would became next up. Okay, and I think that was two thousand I don't know eleven 2012. Okay. I didn't have a clue what was going on So I kind of fell into it, but you had an active plan You you set a crosshairs on a target and then you took the shot. I mean more or less I didn't I didn't make it that first time But is this was around the time that I was? Most inspired by two different YouTube channels one was called Freddy W and the other was called corridor digital But yeah I mean I moved down here with the hopeful intent of working with corridor and within a few months of moving Here I managed to get a part-time job working as like the behind the scenes editor for corridor and I was so I was responsible for like shooting and Editing all of the behind the scenes videos for their main videos And then after a couple years of doing that because I had treated the whole experience like one big internship Because I didn't really know much about filmmaking other than like what I read about in articles and online I didn't really read too many books about filmmaking There's just so many resources available online So between that and watching tons of tutorials and more importantly just trying it out seeing what worked moving on to the next thing After a couple years of doing that I ended up kind of Going back out on my own trying to make my own thing happen and then ended up about like I don't know eight months later coming back to corridor to work with them full-time as a main channel VFX artist and so I've been doing that since about I guess the beginning of 2014 perhaps Yeah Did they know you were super big fan? Okay, like if Destin moved to Mississippi with the entire intent of Working with his heroes Mike and Carl do shirtless nunchucks Like I'm guessing that he would be super socially awkward He'd fanboy all over himself and They'd be like you can't do shirtless nunchucks with us because you're just like you're you're weird and you make us uncomfortable How did you do with that? Did you play it really cool like socially was an all-rider where you kind of panicked and fanboying? I mean the first time I met them. There's definitely a fanboying element I kind of accidentally fell into being in one of Freddy's videos while I was the one night I was there they were shooting this splinter cell video It was like a parody where they shoot at light bulbs and stuff and I just I just happen to be there They needed to release a video the next morning and they were starting to shoot it that night and they're like hey You're our goon now and I was like okay I Think back around that time and I can't help but feel that I was very awkward But I also just feel I was an awkward I was a more awkward person over the last decade of being down here in LA I feel like I've kind of come into myself Accepting my own personality accepting who I am as a person and just letting my my passion kind of take the steering wheel I guess I've I think most people would say a decade in LA makes you much less awkward I Been wanting to talk to you about this for a year. Oh wow I was watching the Mandalorian behind the scenes thing that they put out mm-hmm And I thought it was really nice and I covered all the things that you'd expect you've got Favreau and Filoni on there talking about Narrative arcs and yeah, what they were going for with the characters and all of that was very fun And that that's my wheelhouse. That's the stuff that I found interesting. Oh absolutely. I mean me too. It's great I just feel like characters are not intriguing anymore. They're overwhelmingly just they exist to make a statement about this or that Feel like on that show you've still got some characters who are just characters and wherever the winds may blow Like real people. That's why I like the show. I thought it was fun I will say spoiler alert just in case somebody hasn't watched the Mandalorian Like you're probably gonna want to tap out for the rest of this episode at this point. They deserve the spoilers. They do Well, obviously they spent a bunch of time talking about what went into the Luke Skywalker decisions In the final episode of season two well hold on just want just so we're clear or so I'm clear Are you talking about at the end of the episode? Where Luke Skywalker comes in and it's Mark Hamill Yeah, it's not it's not like the real like now Actor it's the actor from back in the day So they had to create a young actor is that what you're talking about Matt? Yeah, so it looks like return of the Jedi era Mark Hamill. Yeah motorcycle accident scars and all exactly He got into an accident. Yep, and I remember really wanting it to work when I saw the episode real time and Just wanting there to be no uncanny valley and wanting it to feel right It was good enough in the moment for me to be like I think I can just let myself enjoy this is a neat moment This is pretty cool. It doesn't look like his mouth is moving right. I can just play along with that Okay, and so it was fun Everyone's an aw you can only talk to people who've seen it for a few days because you don't want to steal that Yeah, somebody else and then a few months go by and I see a video that you put out taking another run at the Luke Skywalker sequence and It's really good and it's really fun to see how you did it I watched it a few times trying to really understand what was going on there, okay, and I made a mental note I thought okay, well clearly the Disney folks are gonna see this Those guys care more about making good content than they do about looking cool I don't think John Fabros and ego guy I think he's a story guy and an excellent sky and this is gonna light a fire under them in a way that I think is going to be Interesting well, sure enough we have tangible evidence that I think it might have they hired a an actual deep fake artist who is one of the most prolific deep fake artist on YouTube his name is Shmooc and Our least his YouTube name is I forget what his actual real name is But they've now hired him and that's about the extent of what we know publicly and so I Think they are going to be taking this deep fake stuff more seriously for season three of Mandalorian or whatever else Disney and and or I'll end You know does with this sort of technology because it's very much so an evolving tech, right? It's it's so to kind of give you guys like a baseline of what they did for Mandalorian season two the very end with the Luke Skywalker in the past. There's a couple different ways they would do it There's the full CG route. They did this with Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia in Rogue One They've also done this with the type of de-aging stuff that you would see in sort of the Marvel films Where you'd have like an older actor playing a younger version of themselves and that's kind of a lot of toody work It's a lot of just a lot of motion tracking and photo shopping and very talented artists who know anatomy very well Lola effects is is responsible for a lot of that sort of stuff Then you have this new tech called deep fakes coming in which is essentially just AI Learning and understanding a face so well that it can replicate its under any situation and That has this raw power to be able to do a lot of cool stuff But at the same time it's still computer code and it's not creative. It can't make its own decisions It's just guessing based off of what training it's done And so if you have limited input data, you're gonna have limited output data as well, you know What's garbage in garbage out? I was trying to think what is it? Garbage goes in this side. No, you got it. Yeah I mean yeah, and that's that's pretty much the crux of any sort of AI related tool Right you have these models that are trained off of things and it's able to create things based off of that training But if that training is incomplete you're gonna have an incomplete result and so so kind of the plot of the Empire Strikes Back Yeah, sure I guess And so you're also trained by the experience of the artist And so ILM is one of the best VFX companies in the world right now There's a few of them that are at the top and I'd say ILM is in the top three I don't want to say they are the top or number two, but it's interesting You have these VFX houses who Their literal business model is to create visual effects to create magic in cinema And they are tasked with doing the impossible a lot of the time and they figure out ways to do it but also They have a pipeline, you know when you're having to kick out thousands of shots You can't be experimenting with unproven methods And and stuff and so you have to then fall back on your traditional methods that you do have a lot of experience with and we kind of saw a weird hybrid With that on the Mandalorian When I first saw this episode it was it was literally a year ago December of 2020 and I had to wait a day to see it My wife was working that night and so I couldn't watch it until because I wanted to remain alive And so I didn't watch it without her So everyone in that 24-hour period had sent me Uh or not sent me anything they had asked me what my thoughts were on the end of the video Most people didn't give me any spoilers. There are a couple who mentioned a Luke Skywalker So I kind of knew something was up going into it and My first impression was Interesting. It wasn't like a negative or positive. It was just like a oh There's something going on here. And so I guessed that they did not do a deep fake It looked computer-generated to me. It had this weird sort of non Deep fake sort of look to it, but at the same time it kind of did and I was so confused And I became so certain that it wasn't I want to put a pin in that because I want to ask you Yeah, I mean for us. I don't know what that means Yeah, you're non-deep fake. We know we know all these words, but we don't know the definition of the words in your mind Right. So so you're saying oh it could have been CG or could have been deep fake And and that means something to you that it doesn't mean like to me deep fake is It was a reddit username That someone was using to create videos of people that weren't actually people Okay, and we'll just leave it at that And so that's what a deep fake originally that's where the the name got coined. Is that correct or was it for chan? I don't remember honestly. I'm not exactly sure. It was one of those it was it was somebody's username and we just we'll just leave that in the past And so that that moved forward into a verb It got transferred into a verb And so deep fake is when you use artificial intelligence to try to recreate or wrap someone else's face On the movements of an actor correct is that an accurate way of saying that? That is pretty good. Yeah, what does CG mean in relation to that? So CG is basically you have an artist using their own creative intent to recreate Something right they're creating it from scratch now. They can have tons of reference They could even have the source material at hand to be able to use but at the end of the day They're still rendering something which requires them to recreate the animation and the lighting You know, you can use tons of different tools such as motion tracking Keyframe animation you have vfx supervisors on set who are able to capture the sort of Onset lighting that you would have the directionality and intensity and color of that light And you can use those things to try to Replicate and simulate what a face would have looked like in that situation a deep fake on the other hand just looks at the footage And is able to determine the orientation of the face. It's able to literally infer the lighting Uh, you know, like I was saying intensity direction color of the light on the face and basically recreate that With a different face and it does that through a couple different means Uh, first off it it tries to learn how to recreate the face that it sees as accurately as possible And so it'll go through tons and tons of iterations where the computer has Two options it has the original ground truth Of what the face should look like and it has its results And then it compares them and you get a sort of error average type deal And then it just it's like, okay, I learned something from that I'm going to try it again and it gets a little bit more accurate and then a little bit more accurate And that's just trying to recreate what it's seeing Previously before you even start the deep fake you have to do training on the face that you want to plaster on there And so for that you need to teach the AI model What this face looks like? So you want to just give it as many different images from as many different orientations As you possibly can with as many different lighting situations as you possibly can so that it has the best understanding of what a face is Specifically what that face is so now you have an AI that is trained on a face that you want to put somewhere and now it's training itself on Recreating the face that it's looking at and the footage that you're eventually going to use And then it'll do a third thing where it'll then plaster on That sort of face there But this time it doesn't have a ground truth to to compare it to And that's where the artist comes in and decides and determines whether or not that face is good enough for a final result And at the end of all of that once it's done millions and millions and millions of calculations and iterations, I should say A ton of iterations you eventually end up with this exported face and it's literally just a mask It's it's like the bottom of the lips to the top of the eyebrows And it's just a rendered out image with transparency around it So it's not the full head It's not the full shot and then you just layer that on top of the footage And most of the time it kind of just works The tells for me for deep fakes are when the the training data isn't quite good enough and you end up with weird sort of artifacts such as the eyes looking in slightly different directions or like the teeth kind of like Moving around like sometimes you end up with like a little middle tooth And then you can kind of see it sliding around as it's trying to determine where the teeth are And so it kind of struggles with some of those weird subtle details But it's very very good at getting animation and lighting right which is most of the battle You know speaking of battle the analogy that was happening in my head as you were talking i've spent some time with machine learning and um Building the library is the hard part. Yes, that's one of the many hard parts And that's where the intellectual value is the intellectual property But your explanation of that felt like someone in an f16 flying over a world war one trench warfare battlefield like you just like you you just kind of like We like like there was so much information that you passed over like inference and like all these different things You have deep knowledge in this area and and you're trying to dumb it down so we can understand it Is that accurate? Well, I would also like to clarify. I am absolutely not an expert in in machine learning or deep fakes Niko from corridor is our resonant sort of deep fake expert. He was the one who took the lead on our Luke Skywalker deep fake video I'm around enough and that i've been able to sort of ingest a lot of that knowledge I've gone through the process of creating a deep fake so I I have that sort of experience But I don't have the extended experience of doing it on many different shots We did a previous deep fake before where kiana rebs basically uh saves a person from a robbery Yeah, yeah At a little gas station and I didn't work on that video at all. I was working on a different video at the time and so uh, I didn't really get that sort of Hands-on experience with it. So I I feel like I can't quite say that like i'm a deep fake expert without ever really doing deep Fakes, but I feel like i'm around it enough. I understand it. I understand the sort of Ideas behind him throw on the ball back to matt here. So matt, I think where you were going in that In that behind the scenes directors cut they reference what these guys did right? I don't think they did explicitly no not directly Uh, but they it was so obvious to me that the pressure they were feeling with this whole massive segment in the episode Was from you and was from your video there is sort of this anonymous or vague acknowledgement of like well Some folks looked at this, but what impressed me was if I recall it correctly there was a humility to what they did And they acknowledged there's room to grow on this I think that might be a little open to interpretation. I think iLm and disney and lucas films lucas arts they have I don't yeah, they don't want to acknowledge us We've been trying to get some iLm vfx artists on our show for well over a year now and it's been just very difficult to get a hold of iLm pr but That video was very interesting because I had straight up said on twitter a year ago that I was confident It is not a deep fake and then when we got back after christmas break in january We did a vfx arts react episode to the mandalorian and we looked at the uh at the thing And I was surprised that the other two guys were both like oh yeah, this this is probably a deep fake It looks like a deep fake to me and nico was the one who was certain that it looked more like a deep fake And I was like man, I didn't think it was but you're the expert on this. I'm going to trust your opinion Fast forward a few months several months actually it was way later uh when their video finally came out breaking down what they did for lucas skywalkers face and I felt a little vindicated because it was kind of not a deep fake Basically what I was able to discern was that they had put in a huge amount of effort trying to do a deep fake And they did all of this stuff and at the end of the day they still augmented what they got so much That it was basically just a complete cgi recreation anyway I find that to be kind of interesting. It's like they gave it a shot They weren't pleased with the results and so they they fell back on what they were familiar with And you know what huge props to them for doing any of this to begin with because I think they're taking those experience They're learning from them and they're going to They're going to double down on making sure their deep fakes are working next time around because There's literally just like a dozen maybe a couple dozen deep fake experts in the world when they're working on this and they've got just a matter of Maybe a couple months a few months maybe to do all the effects for the entire episode It there's a lot of pressure and you have to deliver for something like this And so I think maybe they got they kind of got nerves that the deep fakes weren't really working And they didn't really have any experts who knew how to do it So so I have a question before before we get into the The meat of the conversation that that I think matt's going to take it in a certain direction We'll see Yeah, well, here's a question I have for you from an engineering perspective Like I understand that we're wrapping a face on a face and we're using computers to do that and that's video I understand that what you can't see is is i'm i'm sitting here at my desk and I like to mess with photography while we talk and i've got Old Film this is a glass plate negative. It's a photo Um taken on a glass plate. Yeah, it's a thing. I like to collect these and so There's something about making a photo Without taking the photo So photoshop, you know changed everything, but there's something to making a photo look real or we'll say making an image look real And then you have to take that one step further to make a video look real And then there's all kinds of other implications that matt's brought to my attention about faking audio And like faking someone's voice. So so here's a question I follow you on twitter at sir render with a w s i r w r e n d e r And you often post these little animation clips that you do and I know you have a mechanical engineering background I know you're very very good with cad you're very good with blender. It's clear You've been working with blender and things of that nature you are working with blender correct technically cinema 4d But they're the same program. Okay. Got it So you're starting to post things that the only way I can tell that they're not real Is your fake camera zooms Like you're you're putting in like really quick camera zooms and stuff like that. I'm like, okay. Well, I know cameras I know cameras can't do that. However The lighting the textures Everything you're adding in You don't put lens flare in there. You're gonna you know you could but you don't All these little things that you're adding in there even the background bokeh You're controlling it. So my question before matt takes us in a different direction is from an engineering perspective How do you create something that looks photorealistic? And then how does that extract or extrapolate out towards video? So the first question is Using your engineering brain describe what makes an image look photorealistic And then take me to the next level and turn that single image into a moving image. Oh gosh, that's a deep question Uh I think it's not too hard to make an image look photoreal because you can hack things together Like for photoshopping for instance, you can literally take a real image of someone's face and photoshop it onto another person's face and It looks pretty real because the source is all real But the moment it becomes video now you're having to deal with all the subtle ways Something moves between you know 30 times. I'm looking I'm looking I'm not talking about people. I'm looking at a okay sure sure a rendering you did here of those little rubber Poppers we had as a kid. Yes. Yes. Okay. First of all, is this real or is this fake? I I don't know genuinely It was fake Okay, so you created this out of nothing I'm showing a video real quick of another one Of those things. Yeah, and so I spent a lot of time Creating the materials for those little poppers to get like the sort of the way light interacts with that dialed in just right That's the transmissivity. So that's like the diffuse versus the spectral reflection of light like those are two spectral reflection is a mirror Diffuse reflection is like the surface has a bunch of little jagged spots on it And so the light doesn't completely reflect clearly. Oh, man, that's that's almost more technical than I'm prepared to answer But you're doing you're doing all this you may be just have different words sure yeah, so first off Technology is amazing render engines have gotten so good that you can literally just like Turn it on and it looks great like it's very easy. I use octane render It's a path tracing render engine. So path tracing being like Oh gosh, man, we can we can get deep on all this Path tracing is kind of like ray tracing you have these points of light that are simulating how light works It hits the surface bounces off geometrically and then hits another surface bounces off and eventually makes it way to your eyeball And along the way it picks up difference It loses energy in various ways whether it's losing some frequencies causing it to be a different color It's probably losing some actual energy by bouncing off things So it's it's becoming a little bit more dim and different surfaces Have different properties that will absorb or reflect that energy differently and so So much about rendering comes down to the materials. It's not about the actual light So it's all in the materials and this has taken me so many years to kind of wrap my head around because You have materials that are reflective you have materials that are diffuse they are not very reflective You have materials that are reflective, but they're very rough Think of that in terms of like a christmas ornament you got that really shiny glossy Red orb, but then you've also got the shiny sort of matted red orb, right? They both have the same amount of reflectivity, but one has a very rough surface So when the light hits it it's bouncing all different areas as opposed to where it geometrically should be going and so That kind of creates a different look And then you also have certain amounts of transmission So the light ray will hit an object and it'll actually penetrate it a little bit Maybe it penetrates it You know a little bit into the surface. Maybe it penetrates halfway through it. Maybe it goes clean through like with class You'd be surprised how many surfaces Actually will absorb that light like it'll penetrate it a little bit skin is probably the best example of it If you've ever taken a flashlight and like shown it through your thumb or something like that your thumb actually glows red a little bit And that's because light is penetrating into your thumb and then exiting the color of what's inside your thumb Which is you know a lot of blood redness. Yeah, exactly And it's all very complicated and it's taken decades For render engines to get to a point where they can just provide the tools for artists to choose What materials they want to replicate and so for photorealism Light is obviously very important But it really comes down to the materials because now you're trying to replicate Real-world things that we're all familiar with and so if you compare say a wood table to I don't know pavement Two very different materials and they could be rough they could be reflective depending on a lot of different factors And so you have to Specifically choose what those settings are going to be for that material now fortunately in this day and age There's a lot of sort of I guess for lack of a better phrase presets They're not quite presets But there's like material libraries that you can pull from like someone's already put in the work for figuring out what concrete or pavement Should look like and primarily what it usually comes down to is the image The diffuse texture as we call it the albedo and this is the the color information The pattern on the on the concrete you got the black and then the yellow strips in the middle, right? You can like take pills to help keep that albedo at a certain level of I mean and sometimes the pavement doesn't look like pavement. It's okay. It happens the best of us hardly ever So yeah, it's it's very complex and it's hard to create something photo realistic because there are so many settings they have to dial in and You know it you can literally have like say two dozen different settings and just through the laws of how I it's a Statistics, I don't know like what do you call it? Like the number of permutations you can have from a small number of numbers, right? It's a lot I forget the mathematical naming for this type of idea But literally just like a couple dozen settings can recreate everything you see a lot of permutations Like it just exactly said yeah, yeah, and it can change it can change it from looking like shiny metal to fur, you know Everything in between just by adjusting these settings here and so Photo realism comes down to being able to get those settings correct for the materials not the lighting The lighting has their own settings as well such as the intensity this sort of fall off you have But that's where the render engines come in and they kind of take care a lot of that stuff for you Back in the day when I first started learning how to do CG rendering I was using a program called mental ray or this standard renderer and these were not Unbiased renderers they were very biased and that's a whole other definition These days we use unbiased rendering. It's basically it's trying to simulate reality You don't really have any control over what it does. It's like it's either on or off and you get Ray tracing and it just works back in the day you had to turn on certain things like global elimination the number of rays that you would have to Sort of bounce right and you could you could change those settings to get a more realistic results And that was super hard because now on top of the couple dozen settings you have for materials You've got a couple dozen different settings for the world and the sort of laws that your world behaves by Like the world doesn't behave without global illumination light comes from everywhere bouncing off of the walls off of the sky And without global illumination it looks unreal. It doesn't look real at all Probably my favorite example of that type of thing is the color of a shadow if you're outside and you look at a shadow from you What's the color of that shadow? Most people would say like isn't it kind of like a dark gray type thing? Well, if you're outside on a sunny day that shadow is blue It's a blue color shadow and that's because you're it's a shadow is the absence of light and Out when you're outside what that really means it's the absence of the primary source of light So the sun is a very white perhaps slightly yellow color and Everything around you or the shadow is lit by that and so therefore it's colored by that But the shadow there is no sunlight there so it's having to be lit by everything else What is the second largest light source outside of the sun? Just the atmosphere. Yeah the blue sky Yeah, I had a really weird thought one time when I was I was outside peeing On the side of a building classic. Love is like in the yeah And so I noticed I was looking at the shadow of my stream of urine And I noticed it wasn't there I noticed that the shadow wasn't there I mean there were other shadows there very tiny shadows But there was not a shadow of the stream of urine And I was like that's weird and I was like sitting there peeing and I was doing the math And I was like thinking about the angle of the sun world to me I was like oh if I move closer to the wall Then there's going to be a shadow and so I you know I moved closer to the wall And the shadow appeared and I was like why does the distance of the stream from the wall affect the shadow and it was a little bit of a documentation research later that I Understood the concept of an umbral shadow I'm not sure I'm familiar with that specific term So an umbral shadow is like the fuzziness of a shadow is a function of the width of the light source And the distance between you and where you're casting the shadow That's why shadow puppets work with your hand at a certain distance and they work best with a point light source But if you had a light box then you would get a really soft shadow on your On your you know your little hand dog thing absolutely right. I love this. So I realized oh the shadow matters because of Geometry and it's the width of the light source and that's why Like right now there's a across the room here. There's an led light source And it's got a bunch of little leds in it And if you could you know at a certain distance you could actually count the number of leds in the light source By the number of shadows it casts. Yeah, anyway, I'm sorry I'm derailing this that's an amazing observation because you're totally right If you think of a giant softbox as being a matrix of point lights That's essentially what it is But if you have a very nice diffuse filter over it the resolution of those point lights becomes greater You end up with so many different points that they all kind of just blend into one large Diffuse lighting shape, but you can still kind of break it down at one end of the softbox You're looking at your subject and the rays are going outwards like this right And on the other side of the lightbox It's doing the same thing but from a different starting point And so if you just take either end of that softbox and just like say it's two point lights They're going to create a double shadow Uh around your subject here. Yeah, but behind me. I've got this bookshelf And I have two lights one on each side of the room And so I've got two shadows here and I'm constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of this shadow in the middle So you just need more lights just to make one long strip of lights around it Any more global lighting you're teaching me things, right? So that sort of like example there where you got the the double shadow thing going on That's in essence the sort of bounds of your shadow But then you have all the lights in between that are going to start incrementally moving that shadow inwards until it's just a single point from the center And that's where the the core of the light is It's where most of the light is going to be shared from and so that's where the strongest shadow is going to be And as it goes out to the side where you have fewer of those points kind of pointing at that spot The shadow is going to be dimmer and it creates this sort of illusion where the shadow becomes fuzzy And more sort of like blurred out. I love it. It's awesome Yeah, okay, I'm going to cut myself off here because I could talk to you about this stuff forever But I think where matt At least in our conversations about preparing for this matt had some really interesting points And uh, okay So we're just going to assume that that is an endless well that you and I could go down together But we're going to stop it matt I'm really interested to hear the things that you were interested in talking about Hey, let's peel back a little bit of the curtain here. I think that'll be fun. Okay, so Let me kind of explain uh who this uh, this sponsor spot is for I've got it right here. Hold on matt. Let me say something here. Okay. Hey, this episode of notom questions is brought to you by hello fresh I have control of your voice Uncomfortable I have control of your voice on an episode. We're talking about deep fakes How do you feel about that? That's so weird. I know hey, hey, guess what What if you've been listening for a while? You know the deal with hello fresh They make pre-measured ingredients the meal kit delivery service. It's all measured the right way It's delicious. It's awesome. It shows up at your door. You don't have to go to the grocery store Yeah, yeah, how'd that feel matt just to hear your voice every every word of that is dripping with integrity and accuracy I have no problem with it. I'm not uncomfortable at all. I'm fine. Yeah, I know I'm not fine. You're not fine. It's just a little weird It's a little weird. How can that be weird? What are you doing to me? Are you messing with it? Are you making it sound different? No, that's just you. Did you slow me down 20% there? No, it's just you I just I just got the file from when we Recorded last time and I just pulled up your voice to play it for you and I just assumed it felt weird So there you go it did feel weird yet everything that I said I stand by yeah This episode is sponsored by hello fresh It's mill kit delivery service and we love them They send meals directly to your house all the things that matt said there when I was controlling his voice They are true And uh, I I just I'm delighted by the concept of delicious meals coming to my house And I get to cook them with a family and we get to eat cool stuff I'm increasingly delighted as I get into a little colder time of the year and as the world is a little bit weirder I'm increasingly delighted at the opportunity to just stay home and have my food show up there And then we just do all of the things together because we are in A very magical time as a family a time that I think years from now We will all look back on and be willing to trade a lot to relive even one night of cooking and eating together to just Enjoy this is the golden time for us and doing food this way when we're able to do it It contributes to that dude. What why are you gonna like? Raise the nostalgia flag And make me realize that cooking with my family in the kitchen is a privilege that is going to change Why why would you do that to me? Truth I mean, I don't know. I just feel like we we try to be honest with each other and like say the things that we think I thought that's what we were doing. That is what we're doing terrible. I'm so sorry for whatever just happened in the heart But it's true dude and I'm thinking in those categories more all the time like the the math equation I'm running on time and money and People and relationships is more and more going through this funnel of realization That there's not like a next time that I'm super excited about This is the time I've been looking forward to as as a man as a husband as a dad It's beautiful right now and not getting it back and stuff like this contributes to it in a really positive way So I'm I'm grateful for it and I I like it when we get to do it Back out okay, I'm sorry back all the way back all the way back and talking points, right? What's our offer? Yeah, what is it? Looks like the offer is that you can go to hello fresh.com slash ndq14 And then use the code ndq14 and you get up to 14 free meals and three free gifts Gifts gifts. That's what it says is you give three free gifts. What does that mean? I don't know. I haven't signed up for this one I've been a customer for a while so I haven't tried the three free gifts, but I'm Intrigued like do you get the bothers me that I don't have the gifts yet? Do you get the gifts or do you get to give the gifts? I gotta know I think you I think you get the gifts that is what the language indicates to me That's amazing if getting an Stunningly large amount of food wasn't enough also gifts that really like hell of fresh man They understand this internet thing They just help people's brains are wired Yeah, it's it is a mystery box. Okay. All right. I see you. Hello fresh up in your game that works So, I mean that's it. That's the offer. So if you like these kinds of things you can go to what is it matt? It's hello fresh.com slash ndq14 And then you use the promo code ndq14 check out Awesome. Yeah, thank you for supporting the podcast by supporting the sponsors It's a big deal and sorry we got on the nostalgia bus for a second there or maybe I'm not who knows who can know Yeah, I'm not emotionally clear on whether I'm sorry about that or not all I am clear on Is that the relationship angle on hello fresh is more important to me now than it has ever been And so that's just the truth of the matter. That's what it conjures for me right now Most of my intern writing is Educational bible stuff, but I try to very intentionally frame it for People who think there's a deity behind the bible and people who don't okay in one way or another is very influential document I mean the most influential document in the history of history. Oh easy. Yeah is that particular Best-selling book of all time and people make a lot of different things of it And what I find as I get feedback on that is that people feel pretty intimidated by it They feel like this is something for experts or zealots people who hold very passionate opinions It's from a very foreign culture at a very distant time And it feels like at best it's this entirely subjective thing Where really people are just going to do whatever they want to do with it And then throw the force of god behind their opinion and it's going to get weird and that can't happen for sure But one of the things that we figure out is we start working on it together Is it even though there is a ton of technical stuff there history language culture Narrative genres we're familiar with genres that might be lost to history that we're trying to cobble back together A mology and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah, what do you do with jona? Is it is that a literal history story about a thing that happened? Well, I mean it could be the story holds itself out as involving The maker of all things. I guess somebody could get swallowed by a fish and live in there and barf backed up You know if such a or maybe it's some kind of metaphor the point is There's just all these little moving parts that you don't think about until you start getting into the world of it and likewise I Is just some idiot sit with my family. I eat some bunch of crunch a little popcorn whatever and I'm like, hey That's freaking Luke Skywalker like from when I was a baby. Look at him. There he is right there Like star wars is danced around this forever Everybody else is always on the star wars stuff and clone wars and everything else but never Luke Like Luke's the rock star. He's the the holy grail the untouchable thing I was literally about to say he's the holy grail of nostalgia for star wars. Yes The holy grail of nostalgia for everything For anybody under 55 or 60 years old right now like that's the guy the character And they've been so hesitant to put him in front of us that You know that for me, I'm not sitting there thinking about the technology very much passing thoughts like I really want this to work But mostly it was pretty easy for me to just go with it and be like hey, this is great That's so they did their job suspension of disbelief right right and and so for me You know, I don't get everything that that's going on behind that. That's not my job That's very intimidating to me Because I'm not trained in this this is what I do much like when people come to an ancient near eastern document that They don't know the languages. They don't know the history. It's an intimidating thing But what I find is if you really sit down and you start working on the actual raw materials Not the religious conclusions just the raw materials of the document with somebody What you figure out pretty quickly is if you just kind of encourage them on like yeah But what do you see in the conversations you have right? But what about all the stories you've read like well What would you do or think if you were confronted with such a situation or somebody came at you with these kind of words like what we're seeing in the Text and in the story pretty quickly people start to fall back on their own intuitive Organic learning they've gathered all this data over the course of their lives socially And they know what kind of looks right and they know what kind of doesn't look right socially And they can imagine even cross culturally cross linguistically How people would probably behave because of how humans are because they are great interpreters yeah very well practiced interpreters Even if they don't know it we all have a lot of experience with people and so it's just kind of this this thing Where something passes the smell test or it doesn't yeah exactly yes Yes, and so what listen to you two guys talk I'm sitting here going like I didn't I didn't know the term for whatever that P shadow is but Yeah, I have peed on stuff before yeah, it's true that shadow does work that way. That's kind of crazy And the shadow gets more intense the closer to the the end rather than far But I'm a very close peer so for me that's a very very intense yeah I've got powerful hips so I can get right in there The the thing about it is though like everything you guys are describing When I hang around with Destin just gradually Words get ascribed to phenomena. I've observed my whole life. I just didn't know there was a word Yeah, doesn't you learn that I'm like oh well, I can't hang with you I don't know I don't know that stuff but I can at least learn the language and kind of get it and Oh great. So you're working in this field Where people are probably the most experienced interpreters of anything they're good interpreters of I would argue that you're average human the best thing the most Experienced thing they are in terms of interpretation Is that the human face and the human body? It's so ingrained into us. We can see faces in a toaster. We can see faces in a cloud If we see just the hint of a reflection of somebody in the room who's trying to spook us We might not know they're there but we feel like somebody's there because Subconsciously we see face we see humanity. It's like us. We see ourselves in others Which means that if something's wrong That is going to drive us Freaking crazy in ways we can't articulate But if something passes our interpretive test That could trick us into believing something is real that absolutely is not When I watch your stuff when I listen to you in destined talk right now That to me is that fascinating place. It's all very interesting. It's all very technical That's great, but doesn't it really come down to? How it affects the people who put eyes on it and if it's gross and a failure It's because it doesn't pass their interpretive smell test that they've built over the course of a lifetime of learning 100% and if it does pass the smell test You're some sort of modern Subdiety or demigod Sorcerer go out and change reality To make things whatever reality needs to be to suit the purposes of whoever writes the change And so the stakes are it's amazing How thin that line is between that sucked These people are terrible. I don't believe that's Luke Skywalker for one second And the line between that and like woded can it can't he's actually break up that robbery He's even better than I thought didn't canada just declare war on finland Uh or that we've seen less of that than I would have expected by now The barrier of entry is still a little too high Question number one To what degree do Conversations about ethics come up not that I have any charges or accusations I just think the whole thing's fascinating and interesting But I mean to what degree do the conversations about ethics come up in affects circles like what do we think about using a dead actor? What do we think about? Youthifying somebody what do we think about just how it'd be fun if this were will feral doing this instead of jimmy kimmel Does it come up? I mean it does come up like we definitely had conversations about the the ethical nature of us using kiana reaves Like likeness I guess in a video for ourselves And i'm not exactly sure where I sit on that sort of like moral Line right I don't i'm not exactly sure we crossed the line there I think we we tried to make sure that it was parody enough and ridiculous enough that everyone just Understands that this is not actually kiana reaves And same thing with the we did a deep fake tom cruise back in the day And this was way earlier in the text So that was a little bit easier even to be able to get away with because no one was really full It looked great. It was good. It was good. Oh, well. Thank you I mean like it looked good in my opinion, but I don't know for me It was just like I instant the moment I see it. I I instantly knew like okay This isn't real But it's cool that we made this you know and and like you're saying about How we are very good at recognizing faces. I think that's that's an extreme understatement I I believe that our brains recognizing faces and just understanding them and identifying them is the most advanced algorithm our brain has And so, you know, when you're trying to fool that you have to have an incredibly advanced sort of results to fool that algorithm It's one thing to make Some little rubber popper toys and rubber and asphalt and in glass and whatever else look You know look real because now we're having to Just draw upon our personal experiences interacting with those things in our lives If we don't have much experience interacting with a certain type of material We don't actually know what it should look like And that's just for those things with faces and whatnot. It's like Not only are you drawing on your own personal Sort of experiences you're drawing upon the evolutionary experiences of our brains understanding that faces are important and therefore Put more experience points in that in that area We're only just now at a point where we're starting to be able to replicate that And be able to fool those advanced brain algorithms and so in terms of the ethical nature of things Right now it's still early enough that the barrier to entry is high that the only people who can do that sort of thing are ethical people Ish like I mean I think Everyone is perhaps slightly unethical to a degree But you have these situations where the only people who know how to really do this Are doing it for themselves for fun for doing it in the light. Yeah, and and so and There have been Situations where deep fake I mean deep fakes literally came about for replicating like female people in certain types of videos and That was that's you know, that's very unethical. That's not okay and and yet that was what they were used for quite a bit and My fear I remember having a big fear. What what's going to happen when someone's able to recreate some sort of politician or celebrity? doing something in a natural a seemingly natural environment and situation And then they make the video it looks pretty real they put it up on twitter It goes viral and everyone now just believes that this is fact And I think That is going to be a problem But it's not really been too big of a problem yet at least in terms of well, you could crash a stock market You could start a war You could activate sleeper cells With that kind of thing. I mean, yeah, but like I mean, I mean think about how influential I mean Elon Musk Mudders something about how he feels about bitcoin on a given day and then and the world changes overnight effects gajillions of usd in bitcoin value I mean if you wanted to be malicious with that and you had the power to use other people as a puppet Yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of potential for for evil. So here's a question What about how about apply that same sort of thinking in arguments for photos because photoshop has been around for Almost three decades at this point over three decades people have been recreating politicians and celebrities in You know, not flattering situations for decades and yet some of those and yet We've not really seen too much Really bad fallout come out from that. Well, it's interesting laura iricchio wrote a book about Markey de la fayette and she talked about The the rags or the the old newspapers They there were a lot of things like what you're talking about drawn in caricature form And so it's been happening forever like people draw Their enemies and in compromising situations. And so the question is now you can do it for real I'm doing air quotes around real or let's put it this way You can do it in such a way that it gets past this Face recognition algorithm in the human mind that you're describing. Does that does that algorithm have a name by the way? I have no idea um So they seem but now we can do it Now we can do it in in such a way that you can get past that algorithm. And so we've we've crossed a line I think in what matt's talking about like It was cool and funny and ha ha but I think we're good. I mean, I think in your mind right now You have the ability to do it. I mean with enough effort You can very much so recreate a person at this point And it's just going to get easier and easier as every year goes by and the tools become simpler and more freely available Uh, we're not quite at that point yet. And so I am slightly concerned about where that will go Like what happens when the tools become so easy that you know, the people Who shouldn't be doing this sort of thing get their hands on it That question has yet to be answered But the the flip side of this is that fortunately all of this stuff Has a trail, you know, there are artifacts that come out and these artifacts for a very long time came down to our our sort of, you know brain algorithm test does it seem real does it seem fake and With when it is better than that you have to fall onto these other things. The great thing about Uh deep fakes is that they're made by ai The great thing about ai is that they can see other ai And so there are these other tools being developed specifically Designed to be able to trace in track Whether or not an image has been digitally manipulated. Is this the you're talking about a gantt again? What is that called a general adversarial network? Yeah, i'm i'm i'm mixing two ideas. I'm wrong I'm pretty sure it's like It's all the same thing. It's literally like an anti deep fake essentially. It's kind of figuring out what Generative adversarial network. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah And again, I am by no means a machine learning expert. I am a machine learning interested party not even in a uh an amateur enthusiast, but There are people creating tools Specifically designed to be able to tell whether or not an image has been Photoshopped and now we're getting to a point where we can tell whether or not a deep fake has been applied has this And it's looking at a whole bunch of different things because in an image you have millions of pixels That's just like the raw idea of a picture, right? But really you have a file format that is displaying those pixels and certain in those formats obey certain laws for how they compress images and the sort of ways they kind of Save space and so like an mp4 a jpeg Those types of files are very compressed They lose a lot of data and that's how you're able to get like some crazy high res image without much file size If you're ever to look at like the raw high quality Lossless versions of those same files hundreds of times bigger And so when you compress stuff like that You end up with a bit of a paper trail you have like these blocky artifacts And when you Photoshop something from one of those things to begin with you are now moving those artifacts In ways that couldn't have possibly been generated when that file was originally created And most sort of deep fakes today are being created From content that other people made and so the universal format are these low bit rate sort of files You know, you you're able to get a file of a politician Doing something fairly natural. Maybe you ripped it off of youtube Maybe you recorded off your tv or something like that. Maybe you found it in an image. Maybe you I don't know. It doesn't matter what you did chances are It was one of those low quality 8-bit files That you are now manipulating and it's going to leave a trail That still opens the possibility up for getting the lossless versions of whatever and trying to circumvent the sort of Is this real from a file perspective because i've given that thought before I was in a car accident years ago where I was rear ended and I took a video Of the whole situation, you know, you're supposed to document it all but it was it was played at night It was on the highway. You couldn't really see anything So I took it into my editing program and I just boosted the exposure I brightened everything up so that you can see the details of the shot And so when I submitted that to insurance to because it was a bit of a pile up several cars had rear in each other I was not at fault at any point. I will put put that out there That was the point of me taking the video um, but I definitely had the thought of Is this gonna stand up in court? I have augmented this I have manipulated this This is no longer the ground truth of what we saw I have the original video. It wasn't a problem for me because I if it ever became an issue I could just submit it but You know, there's a lot of different sort of ways that you got to like Forensically determine whether or not a video file is real So here's my question at what point does the ability to manipulate video and Change what appears to be a thing a person is saying at what point do we cross a threshold? Where yeah, cool. Ren said there's this artifact thing Well, I'm a nation state with like gobs of money I can make a program that will go and scrub all the artifacts out and make it look even real I can realify it so to speak So at what point does video evidence no longer stand up in court? Because we blurred the line so much. It's like that umbral shadow There's so many sources that are cat, you know, it beyond a reasonable doubt We've injected enough doubt into the system where we know that it could be Affiliate like is there a way to like do we make special cameras that somehow tie a bow on each individual image And verify that it's true like is there how do we do these things? I forget what it was but there was this app That took video and was able to record metadata into the video to Guarantee that this is the original unmodified thing through whatever sort of technology they're using Like you could you could add up the numbers of all the the color values of all the pixels and come up with a check sum or something like that or the histogram Yeah, I've no it was it was meant for journalists In in say like Africa or the Middle East where there's unrest and whatnot and they're trying to get the word out there And that like their phone gets taken by by whoever or and them trying to say that oh this video is fake The biggest problem through all of this right now isn't technological. It's psychological. That's the largest problem It's one thing to be able to prove logically and tangibly that something is real or fake but convincing people To change how they feel is a completely different battle from a technical standpoint There's always going to be a bit of a of a fight between the hackers and the defenders, right? We see this with any sort of platform. There's always You know you get this hacker that figures out some sort of way to get through the system And then you have the the people who are supposed to protect the system fight back and Build up better defenses and now the security is better And that hacker can't quite get in anymore until they make another leap in their abilities or technology or whatever and they're able to hack better now So then now the people defending are having to make better security. It's a constant Back and forth between making something that is Secure and something that is not because there are people trying to break it and I think that same type of Thinking and methodology. I think will also apply to video You know as better video tools become a thing Better Secure video security tools Will become a thing But it's all happening at such a high level now where this I think is where this conversation is going It's like all of that stuff is happening at a level now that it's all just beyond us It's all happening on the back end of things and that we can't see any sort of difference The diminishing returns from the sort of differences are so high level that we kind of just don't care And it becomes more of a psychological issue So it's hard to say, you know, it's uh, will the courts be able to hold up and trust certain Evidence will that evidence be defended well enough if something is fake. I mean this It's it's gonna. It's always been an issue and I think it's gonna continue to be an issue It feels like this is one of those places where that brandylenys bsa symmetry principle applies yet again In terms of we talk about it in terms of misinformation and overcoming misinformation It takes an order of magnitude more energy to overcome misinformation than to create misinformation or absolutely But you reference something around that I think is I found it to be true. I find it to be true in myself and I don't like this And that is that belief is overwhelmingly an emotional decision What we think is true Often leads with the emotions and then the justification comes afterwards And then the justification becomes partially calcified When we articulate it to other people and fully calcified when we shed blood over this thing whether it be metaphorically or literally Yeah, if I burn relationships To defend a thing that I logically articulated because I emotionally felt it earlier on Like now I'm married. Yeah, I This thing that I feel and that I believed and I articulated and argued for was apparently more valuable to me than that relationship Yeah, and so once that blood is shed Wow, you're committed. So all you would have to do understanding how the human brain works understanding how my brain works is Some sort of visual misrepresentation meant to evoke an emotion or a response in me It doesn't need to be that good for that long It doesn't need to be To look valid for very long only a day or two And it could trigger my self-righteousness Trigger it could get me worked up amped up. It could send me to the keyboard to tell all the people how the things are How things ought to be and now I'm already out there and I shed blood and I lost followers And I unfollowed some people and I blocked some people and I doubled down and I used some pejorative Describe how wrong and bad other people are who didn't look at this video evidence and come to the conclusions I did This furthers my narrative enter the sunk cost fallacy at this point Into the sunk cost fallacy as well. Yeah, and so then I go and do that and Then three days later Oh, we run that checksum and sure enough that that image was taken from It was held out as being taken from a reliable app a reliable source. It turns out it wasn't I got manipulated. There's a gun my face, but now I've burned down my relationship with my dad This is all hypothetical. What am I gonna do? It is hypothetical because I have not Even we disagree it's it's pretty good between us I've seen I've seen this happen though in real life matt with with people and they saw a thing on facebook And then they get really angry and yes Yeah, it's hypothetical. It's hypothetical for you, but not for others I've seen this thing with me. I just haven't burned down a relationship with my dad yet Good and so so all of this to say there was a famous political incident I don't want to push anybody's button so I won't be specific with it But it was with an election That happened pre-2016 so wasn't that one everybody but there was a situation where prominent member of one party unapologetically Said and proliferated a thing that was it was definitely not true about the rival party's presidential candidate It was pretty evidently not true. I didn't like the candidate who was being criticized But still it was pretty evidently not true The election came and went nobody really wanted to debunk the thing that had been said and then the the politician who had used mistruths to undermine his opponent Just went on a national television show and was like no No, unapologetically that no that wasn't true But that person was so wrong it accomplished what it needed to So that was the moral justification and it was very difficult It would have been so much more efficient for me to just tell that story with names No, I got you though people are smart they can google and It doesn't matter And the reason I didn't is because the point of the story isn't look how dumb or bad that group is or that group is I don't like political parties. So I think they're all dumb. I hear you But the point is the lie only has to hold up for a little while long enough to get people Sentent emotion spun up Emotionally and long enough to get them to go out and verbally plant that flag And then when people push back on the flag planting long enough to Metaphorically or even god forbid literally shed blood And now it's on it doesn't matter if it was true or not because it ri- Yeah, well, it doesn't matter about what the original file was now. I know who you are And so that for me is the recipe that I see For how even slip shod work could be so easily weaponized against my frail Humanity my frail insecurities to get me to do things to people That I might not otherwise do because Images powerful and narrative is power. Absolutely. And it's not your job to solve that ran. It's just really fun to game No, no, I know for sure I mean, isn't that like the main problem with social media and particularly Facebook today because they don't have any sort of tools combating any of that I mean doesn't I know you've been making videos surrounding misinformation and stuff like that So I have an example of something that is far less malicious But nonetheless in the same realm because we managed to fool a whole ton of people with a video that we put out and people just took it as truth I'm gonna tell that story two years ago. We made a video. Please do boss town dynamics and Basically, it's a parody of boston dynamics Who makes state-of-the-art robotics and they've been getting better and better over the years the robotics are now like bipedal They're walking around they're doing things in the scientists Because they are trying to test the limits of what they've made are you know interfering with the robots and trying to do what they do And we just thought it was so funny because it's like this robot's just trying to walk through a door and you're kicking them Like because we're you know, what's the word for like humanizing some sort of non-human thing Uh, we do that to these robots and we feel bad for them It's an emotional response to what these scientists are just like oh, I'm just testing data like what was the big deal? And so we made a whole video where we created a CGI robot that Looked pretty realistic and we go through all these motions of us testing it, but it's all just so ridiculous We're whipping them with a whip shooting it with a gun like Blowing an air horn around hitting it with a chair like wwe And and the robots just kind of like trying to do its job, which is just Moving a box and we thought it was a really funny video a really funny idea Because it does Yeah, it was it's the perfect recipe for a funny little video What we did not anticipate was the fact that people believed that it was not fake Because what happened is we put it up on youtube and within a matter of hours Someone had ripped it from youtube cut out like the intro and the the ending subscribe push and all that stuff And just uploaded that to twitter now granted they had also Downloaded that the act of ripping it from youtube and re-uploading it compresses it like a couple times And so you end up with a a lower quality version Which helps hide a lot of the sort of visual artifacts that are tells for something that is fake And so I was very proud of the work that we've done I thought it looked great, but I was never really fooled into thinking that it was real So I never really sort of anticipated that people would be and so when it went viral It got like 25 million views in the first like couple days on twitter and Our youtube video did okay, but nowhere near that well And we were having all kinds of celebrities Retweeting it and saying how like robot abuse is bad Everyone's gonna look back on this and this is gonna be the reason why we're all doomed is because we're treating the robots poorly and all this stuff Like big name celebrities are tweeting this out and give me a couple Wiz Khalifa uh steven fry joe rogan who else is several several big ones um Wow, no not steven fry and uh the the the more obnoxious british guy. Nope. You already said it and I already emotionally I should I already tweeted steven fries and idiot and I don't care what anybody says and if you argue with me We're not friends anymore. He shed more blood has been shed. I think that's just mortgage Yeah, and so and that was like wow that was a response We didn't anticipate and then we when we sit and think about it and how people would Would consume it and see it They're just scrolling through on twitter They see this video of this robot that looks real And we're kicking them around and it also looks like the robot They've seen before from boss dynamics the aesthetic of the image is the same even though it says boss town not boston says boss town right there and yet For some reason no one reads that they just see the image of the logo that looks like the boss dynamics logo And they just assume it says that without ever actually looking at because they're just scrolling through on twitter Of this one minute video. They maybe watch like 10 seconds like oh wow man. We're doomed retweet And they just take it at face value assume that it's real move on with their lives And that's a problem. So we saw this happen again with our second boss town dynamics video This time we were a little bit more prepared for it and in hindsight We probably shouldn't have made this video basically we militarized the the robot We the first time we made it we actually got in contact with boss dynamics. They reached out and they loved the video They thought it was really funny. They thought it was great. The second time around they thought it was less funny Because now we're actually starting to deal with real Problems with thinking about the future of robotics what happens when You know, it's it's Terminator. You know what happens when robots learn how to Shoot a gun. We thought it was a funny idea like oh Perfect aim no matter what you threw at them Yeah, perhaps we're a little short-sighted with this sort of moral impact a video like that could have but again same sort of thing Happened so many people thought it was real and as a result Boston dynamics themselves started getting a huge amount of like hate and death threats to like the people who worked there Oh, they could just deploy their robots to keep Oh boy, I saw the video. They actually did like this this had real world like flesh and blood Consequences exactly and we were just having a laugh, you know as the Brits say We thought it was a funny video. We furthered our own abilities. We made the robot more realistic We added a whole bunch of other things like surface imperfections to kind of replicate the flawed nature of materials and surfaces and All that stuff and we're just artists trying to create cool images And so it's it's very easy to lose track of the sort of implications and consequences what we do can have And that was probably the biggest thing for me in my career was like, oh wow Something I worked on has now negatively impacted other people in in reality. IRL granted I don't think anyone ever actually faced any real danger. It's all just online warriors. They're all it's all bark There's no bite But what about when it's not what happens when it isn't just bark and you have some guy go out and it's like Who actually believes that boss dynamics is Going to ruin the world because they fundamentally believe they're evil and Down the line they will create sky net and it's going to doom us all they're going to do everyone a favor by stopping that now Okay, this episode of no-dome questions is sponsored by trade coffee And so basically what we're doing is I'm trying to teach you about coffee And the way I'm doing that is we're accepting the sponsorship from trade And ultimately I hope to get my buddy in Mississippi who who roasts coffee and all that kind of stuff I'm hoping to get him on board and linked in with trade so that he can be a distributor It's one big thing who knows if it's going to work, but I'm excited to teach you about coffee through it Did you get the stuff that I sent you to your house? Yes, I did. I don't understand it, but I have it Okay, this is where we're going to start and I'll just briefly explain what I sent you And then next time we talk about trade. We'll we'll go to the next level. We'll actually use the things So I sent you a coffee grinder All right The coffee beans are roasted And then you grind them up and then you then run hot water through that any number of ways I sent you a coffee machine That'll do single servings And I also sent you these little single serving k-cup things that you put the ground coffee in and you close it And then you can make a single cup of coffee I also sent you something called a french press. Have you ever heard of that? Yes, I have heard those words in that order. I do not understand what that does Okay, so basically you put the ground coffee in the water And then it's got a filter and a little do do my flatcher and you can push the filter down You get all the coffee grounds out of the water. It's really interesting like making of the coffee as a whole thing I also sent you a milk frother. It's like a little Motor That has a little bitty thing at the end that'll spin in the milk and it'll put air in the milk and kind of foam it up a little bit Now there's a billion different ways to drink coffee I just drink it with cream So I buy half and half cream from the store And I get my mug and I put a little bit of half and half cream at the bottom And then I use that milk frother to froth it up and then I just brew one cup of coffee into that. That's what I do Some people put sugar in their coffee. Some people don't some people just drink it straight So anyway That's the equipment. So what I'd like for you to do matt if you don't mind is familiarize yourself with the equipment And then next time we will make a cup of coffee on the ad but for now you got to open all the stuff and get it all out and all that kind of It's a whole deal. All right with your permission. I will thank you for all that stuff by the way That was super nice of you. I appreciate that. Yeah, don't think me think the patrons I I used the patron funds to send that to you. So that's pretty awesome back to the trade thing then What is trade for the benefit of the third chair here fit into this whole equation of? Showing me how coffee works. Okay, so trade asked if they could sponsor notem questions and You've never had coffee. So it's not right for you to try to advocate for coffee So I do drink coffee. I in fact I have a cup right here and Here my mug it's got mountains on it I I like the whole getting the coffee mug you like is a whole thing and so anyway I think that You should at least know what coffee's like I consume coffee and trade is a really cool option because what they do is Forgive me. I don't have the code in front of me. It's like drink trade calm Slash slash ndq drink trade calm slash ndq So trade and then use a promo code ndq, but yeah, that's it Okay, basically what they do is they give you a little quiz You take the quiz and then they'll send the coffee that's right for you to your house and it's fresh roasted the whole deal It's really cool The coffee I got was from a roaster in georgia called alma And I think it's really cool. And so my goal Working with with trade here is I want to get my buddy adam down in mrs. Sippy who who does coffee from nikoragua? I want to get him in the mix here And I'm hoping he can become a supplier for Trade if he meets all their standards of quality and things of that nature. So that's what I'm hoping to do I'm working an angle here because I want to support Adam and what he's doing But I genuinely like coffee and I genuinely like the idea of having fresh roasted coffee sent to my house And so I think it's a win-win-win and I get to use it as an excuse to teach my friend about coffee Well, let me tell you what I've experienced so far with trade I went and I took the quiz And that helped me realize how complex coffee can be for people I I mean I'm learning even as I take the quiz I didn't really know what to fill out or what to do so I was like, I don't know. Maybe that maybe that maybe that And maybe google a couple things to learn a little bit as I was going along And the recommendation looked great to me and so it showed up quickly and it smells really good I've never smelled coffee with anticipation before so this is kind of new to me Oh, it's it's great. Yeah, and just hang with me through this next time We'll get out the grinder and we'll go through the whole process But don't judge coffee by your first cup because it's important to like find the way you like to drink coffee There's many different ways to consume it and so find the way you like it and we'll get there But I just asked for your patience and in the first little bit. Yeah, sure. I'm excited to learn Yeah, so one more time that is drink trade dot com slash ndq 20 bucks off your first three bags Is that correct? That is correct. Yeah, and then you enter the promo code ndq at checkout Thanks to trade for supporting the podcast and thank you guys for supporting sponsors I I'm going to show you a video that I made that I took off youtube that you took down. I took down. Oh wow This is your p shadow video. No Can you see my screen? I can yes Okay, so this is a uh, this is back. This is 2011 Wow Yeah, I know So 38,000 views. I love talking to a couple mechanical engineers about super old That's awesome This is me and some buddies This is a phantom. This is one of the first times I had access to a phantom like away from work And I knew I knew a very little bit about um Video editing So I could do like some rudimentary stuff Um, this was you know back when video editing wasn't a thing. This is my buddy john henry. Can you guys hear the audio? I can yeah, I can yeah Well, so we're gonna try it All right, so I'll just let you watch this. Um, and now just let the third chair listen I'm can you shoot an apple off my head? I can do it with you. Yeah, well, okay. That's no question man I think it's bull. So we're gonna try it. Is this the with the crossbow? Yeah, all right crossbow here. We go Destin you look exactly the same double chin and all So just like random shots Every time you ever gonna see me hug a tree Oh my god, no way. So just describe what you're seeing. Oh my god. Oh, this is so scary. Okay, so So I can say whatever I see here like it's okay. I just described everything you've seen I'm not gonna show this on the internet, but it's it's helpful to describe it So william tell is this old story of this guy who was able to shoot an apple off of a person's head using a bow and arrow So what i'm looking at right now is you with an apple on your head and a friend of yours with a crossbow Aiming it at you and what i'm assuming is An arrow locked and loaded in that crossbow. It's a bolt. Yeah, all right. It's it's You did not you have got to be kidding me Destin sandlin. Oh my god. Do you not? Oh my Destin how He's saying the video I oh All of us fake all of its fake Okay, you put it on the internet. I did in 2011. It was real of course. It's fake You had kids in 2011. I know it's fake My you did not is in reference to the fact that this saw the light of day on the internet This was burning. I was I was learning how to edit I had I was like oh youtube's an interesting thing like smarter every day prop wasn't smarter every day at this point in time This was me learning how to edit And I had the same thought you did ran. I was like oh yeah robots with guns. That sounds great You know what would be funny is if we used a slow motion camera to film an a crossbow bolt going into an apple above my head so this was I don't know that i've ever other than running ai to To up res slow mo. I don't edit slow mo footage But this right here was like the first time I was like, you know, I have the ability to do that For science Destin's flawless dude. This is this is flawless video editing in effect here It's simple like it's just some some masking and layering of two different video clips I'm assuming You're shooting this and then you move away and then the guy with the crossbow actually shoots the the apple And you just stitch the two shots together. That's like one of the first things as an effects artist you can do It's one. Oh yeah, it's vfx one one absolutely And I didn't know your execution is so flawless here. I believed this was real I was like Destin are you serious? I can't believe you did this because I didn't think logically I was only reacting emotionally because you sell this so well with your your panic here Your your sort of fear like it's so believable The moment you said it's fake. I was instantly like first off. Oh, thank god Okay, he's not insane. You're not absolutely out of your mind. Good to know secondly. Okay. Okay. Okay I just see how this can be done. It's I instantly see in in suddenly I had forgotten about this until you were saying oh, yeah I made the thing and I wish I hadn't made it and then I was I was realizing oh, yeah, I did this because I you know I didn't think about it because I was like oh, I know I can I shouldn't ask if I should I should just do it Matt have you never said I've never showed this to you matt No Yeah, I mean it is I cannot even tell you wren How many conversations we have online driving back and forth to home whatever just catching up with each other or offline rather talking about The state of the internet what games people are playing who's taking what angle what's working? What's not like? We're always work shopping this stuff yeah, one of our genres of conversation is the Oh, no, not self-aware didn't think that one through genre of conversation and and we have both observed several things that have happened on the internet probably many times Where we just go? Oh wow didn't think through what that would do to planet earth Yeah, or what that would do to self And you never told me you had one of those. Oh, look at this. Look how stupid I was Do not attempt all persons involved have special training Further I even try to sell even further. I'm a bad person The weirdest part about this whole thing is seeing a video on your youtube youtube channel with only 38,000 views Oh Can you imagine congrats on 10 million by the way? Oh? Whatever man is just we're not trying to win the internet. We're just having fun But I I think what's interesting about this is that I did not think about it. So I was not self-aware Um, it does fool people it fooled you for a brief moment there and To matt's point all it has to do is just Motivate a person for a short period of time and then they can go do something stupid I'm ashamed to say I did not think hey, maybe some Young person will try to replicate this. I did not have that thought And it's it's just so completely dumb. I I feel shame But I mean, I don't know it's just a weird thing It's a weird thing and so I think we're kind of coming up on this threshold with vfx where The abilities and the ramifications of using them are outpacing How do I say this the the vfx artists thoughts about the consequences? Do you think that's an accurate statement? I'm not talking about you because you're a thoughtful individual but I mean In general given enough money there are people right now in Developing nations that need the work need money that would be willing to do a thing for a drug lord in mexico for example or you know I I think we're at a really interesting place Where not enough people know to look for the artifacts you're talking about? And they they don't know that they should probably suspend belief first and then be convinced that it's real I don't know what i'm saying. I'm totally right in that it's it's so hard, you know Because it's so psychological And and and we are our we are emotional creatures first and foremost before logic, you know, it's the bigger part of our brain and I think so anyway and and so When you start giving great power, you know, like the spider-man saying goes with great power comes great responsibility You first got to identify that you have power and I think most of the effects artists don't acknowledge that, you know They don't acknowledge that they can fool people And have real-world consequences from that on top of you know Just tell such a gripping unbelievable story That takes you to a person to a place of wonder that in and of itself is power Storytelling elements that nobody in the past has ever had for the positive For the positive absolutely Gosh, I mean, what was the question there? It was about like the moral moral responsibility that vfx artist should think about There wasn't a question. It was just the the realization that we're coming up on a strange moment in history where photos Slides it was possible to fake them. I mean the soviets did a really good job of it during world war two Um, you know actually editing photos It's happened all throughout history by good guys and bad guys but we're getting to a place where the democratization of Editing tools in a believable way Could be dangerous. I don't know that matt thoughts does articulate that well I'm tracking It's you know, it's it's funny because it's like I have been thinking about this for years And I keep thinking over on the cusp of this becoming a really big deal this becoming like really bad and then like another year goes by and Nothing really bad happened small bag. Nothing burger I mean, there's a lot of female celebrities out there that would you know disagree with my sentiment right now But there's nothing there's not really been any sort of big world-changing Situations to come from this sort of visual effects technology coming out. Is anyone ever deep faked you? Uh other than us no Somebody deep faked you destined they did but that's another thing Our phones are now able to do deep fake stuff You know like snapchat can can now do rudimentary or what was the face swap Where where are you just like it's literally doing a live face replacement and it's and it's not very good right now But what happens when it does become good? You know, it will become good. It will exactly it's it's not a matter of It's when it's Luke Skywalker and the mandalorian and that will happen quickly It's gonna happen way sooner than anyone realizes like everyone's like oh, yeah It's years away. I'm like this might happen in 2022 Like this might happen next year I've been putting a lot more experience points into doing sort of like mobile based video vfx stuff like real-time camera tracking and and cgi rendering just happening entirely on my phone Has kind of been my current obsession because it's starting to reach a threshold where it's looking good enough to share like before now I was always kind of like a a dumb little novelty like oh cool There's a little 3d object in your scene and but it doesn't doesn't look good at all or anything whatever but now we're getting like real shadows on the ground the camera tracking is getting so flawless you can import characters with animations now So that video you did the other day on your twitter account where you had this big one wheel At the top of a mountain and you were walking around it and you had your small one wheel there Are you telling me you did that on your phone? 100% never cut to the computer Oh, yeah, so I'm using this app called polycam to 3d Confirms the thesis that we're close on all of this. Yeah There you can now scan the world I'm using an app to be able to scan 3d sorry scan real-life objects and turn them into 3d models And it's it's still at the earliest stages right now Uh, but it's able to determine sort of material properties Texture channels stuff like that like the reflectivity and the and the roughness and the specularity And color of these maps so that it actually reacts to light differently because when you normally do a photo scan You're just getting the color information and so you'll have like this 3d object based off of a real thing But you have the lighting that was in that situation baked into the 3d model because it's just taking pictures and projecting them onto 3d geometry But now we're getting to a point where they're able to figure out what those materials should Do when hit by light so you're taking you're taking pictures on different levels so it's it's kind of like light are but it's like if you had the ability you're saying what is the spectral reflectivity Of this. Oh, how does this material respond to blue light versus red light? But you know the the big one is if you could do all the spectrum Wow. Yeah, and and and so it's like it's uh And and the computer is just doing this and figuring out because this is beyond the the Skill ability of a person doesn't matter how talented Dude, do you just opened up another like Holy cow like that's that's a huge deal butterfly wings react differently to yellow light Then they do other colors of light. That's why morphos are blue because they have little opticals and optical antennas And so the holy grail of what you're talking about technologically would be a light are a multi spectral light are That has all the colors that the human eye but specifically the three cones in the human eye If you could measure the reflectivity and the spectral response to each of those channels that cones see in the human eye That's it. If you had a camera that did that you could completely recreate photorealism. Couldn't you? I mean probably right now basically it's discerning depth In a model by seeing the same image from different points of view When you photo scan something you take hundreds of photos from as many possible different angles around the real life thing as possible And up until now it's just being able to track It's able to track a specific pixel on your object like let's say this little dot and it's able to see in Triangulate the position of that that points across all these different photos and because of that triangulation It's able to figure out depth and therefore build the 3d model But now we're getting to a point where it's able to figure out. Oh This is the same spot But from this angle that spot suddenly gets very bright because the franelle of the light is hitting it At just the right way suddenly it's getting more reflective and as you continue to go around it You're able to get more data points on that reflectivity And then it's you get all of that out and it's able to figure out. Oh then this certain spot right here on this object Has this level of reflectivity and then you do that for the whole thing So now you can shine a light on it and this this reflective part of the the real life object now as a 3d model We'll react the same way it does in reality And it's all so early days right now apple literally just released this api called object capture because They see the future as being all in ar and vr they're going to release a headset next year And so they think that you know the future of vr stuff there needs to be content We got to make the tools so that anyone can just create this stuff And so they made literally the best photo scanning tool out there But it's just an api and so there's a few companies that are implementing their api into their programs And that's like literally just happening over the last like five six months This has been a thing so far And it's just going to get better. It's going to be easier to use Like you're saying i think uh for the for the the butterfly wings You can kind of recreate that right now if by dialing in the setting specifically and that's that's like high level High level sort of settings now you're having to deal with the index of refraction across different color channels And all of that sort of stuff that's that's kind of beyond me you can but you can absolutely Recreate a butterfly wing but you have to do it manually And I 100 believe we are quickly approaching the point where I can just take a uh I can go to a biology lab where they've got the little butterflies You know on the little pins and the little little picture frame and I could just take I could spend a minute and a half and just with an app on my phone and just you know orbit around the butterfly Just from from standing in front of the picture frame on the wall And be able to see it from all these different angles with lights coming from different directions And then you know 10 minutes later. I have it on my phone with and it's the it's the butterfly optically correct It's nuts Matlin the plane forest man. I can keep going. We're gonna cut ran low so he can go do his vfx work for the day Well, even just what you're talking about there the potential to make What in the past people tried to invent with steam like replicating? Animals one of the stories about the hanging gardens of babylon and some of the the kings and palaces of the east that the old greek historians pre gesas reported was That they had found ways to make metal versions of animals and people had metal zoos that they had crafted that were like alchemical almost this hybrid of engineering and some sort of hidden Heat magic and nobody knew what to attribute it to Okay, this is part of what captured the mind of the the whole steam punk subgenre of fiction and visual artistry and all Okay, sure. Yeah like if you could go and sample and scan every micro detail of even just the Externals of some kind of an animal like that's kind of just fun for me as a side jaunt here mentally to think about like you could make an entire zoo of mechanized steam driven artificial Anamelea you could make a menagerate that is built that way with such specificity that even in the physical world This thing could get that much closer to passing for something that looks like something from the natural world and maybe even something that's gone like to create a living functioning moving expression of something that maybe you have a Taxiderm samples of but we don't have any of the original I mean just I mean Jurassic park Yeah, but a different avenue to get there. Yeah, so all of this conversation like I bring up that last point to say Man, it just makes your imagination run wild with what could be what you could make Just in listening to you here. I have ranged from we could make it completely believable Cryptozoology extinct animal zoo that is mechanical but looks otherwise in the future And you could go to this zoo and you could interact with the creatures and I'd be so fascinating. I've ranged all the way from that type of interesting futuristic wonder to Dang we get much further down that road We could just do everything in a pod if we were suspended in liquid our muscles wouldn't atrophy as fast We could stimulate them with electricity and we could just interact in this hyper realistic virtual world forever Total dystopia to total futuristic optimistic wonder all in one conversation I too am looking forward to the new matrix movie That's where you go Yeah, it's an interesting place where it feels like for most of human history Story has been over here in this other component. It provides some kind of Order some kind of moral framework some type of shared Touchstone that we can all relate to across society And now it feels like our unending appetite for story Which I think is a very good thing and a very human thing and a very unifying thing and a very powerful thing It feels more and more like that that unending interest in story passion for story is something that is Inching toward crossing the line from something fantastical that we enjoy as an escape But like we all know what we're doing here towards something that more and more resembles actuality and One of the next big philosophical moral existential questions that I think philosophers and ethicists people who think about this stuff are going to have to wrestle with is At what point are we into a completely new era of story in terms of how it affects us how it shapes us The technological media we use to encounter it Because I think the realism is awesome and amazing and fun and I just can't get enough of this kind of stuff I also think it is a fundamentally different proposition In terms of our interaction with the narratives that make us To do it the way we're doing it now and the way it looks like it's headed Versus the way we've done it for all of human history Yeah, this is a different exercise and it's going to take us to new places In terms of who we are and how we relate to each other in the big grand shared human story So that's where my head's been. Yeah, I mean in the macro scale of of time in human history We are literally being hit by a shockwave. Yes, and we're seeing it in slow motion But it's a shockwave nonetheless. It's hitting us so hard and so fast that they're we're incapable of doing anything about it We're just now on the whims of wherever the shockwave is going to do to us and Traditionally when you're hit by a shockwave, it doesn't really work out well for you. It's scary to consider and I mean, hopefully we're able to just continue being okay You", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.68, "text": " Dude, I am so excited about this episode.
