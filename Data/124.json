Back at you, my friend. Uh, I am in favor of doing a simpler episode this time around. Um, cause I want to spend time with family. I assume you're in the same place. Yeah. I very much am at the same time though. We got a lot of history with the third chair. And so I want to check in with the people who do this with us. Yeah. So I don't know. I had an idea and I think it's pretty simple, but I think I think you'll get a kick out of it. Um, I watched your latest video about the Magi in the Christmas story, the, the wise men that came to visit Jesus as his birth, uh, or maybe not birth, a little after his birth. And, uh, I had some questions and I thought it might be fun to talk about it a little bit. And then maybe, I don't know, in the past, we've, we've read the Christmas story. I think it'd be interesting to read a bit of that. If you're cool with that. Uh, yeah, for sure. Okay. So questions I had. So we do this thing in my family for Christmas gifts where we, we don't follow this completely. I mean, like incredibly strictly for the children, but when I was growing up, there was no rhyme or reason to how many gifts you got. And my parents did great. Uh, my mom is an excellent gift giver. Uh, and, and my, my daughter is really good at giving gifts. But one thing we do is we give three gifts to the children to model what the wise men did in the Bible. Have you ever heard of people doing this? Hmm. Mm. No, I have not, but yeah, I see what you're driving it. Yeah. So, um, this is my wife's idea and I love it. And we've been doing it for a while. So some years we kind of follow it. Some years we don't, but the three gifts, uh, in the Bible were gold, frankincense and myrrh. And so we, we basically do it like this. Gold is something of great value. And so we'll give the kids something they really want. Frankincense was, uh, help me understand what frankincense is. This is like a spice or an herb or something like that. It's something it was used to prepare. Bodies, right? Well, what is frankincense? No, I think myrrh was used for embalming. I think frankincense was something that purified the air. If you burned it, it made everything smell amazing and clean in a time in the history of the world where there were a lot of competing smells from outside and on the body that would make things not so fresh. But it's very valuable, right? Oh, yeah. All three of the gifts were super valuable. So yeah, the idea is that the gold is a gift you give a king and the myrrh. And so that would be evocative of the biblical Christian theme of Jesus being a king who came to initiate a greater kingdom. The myrrh would look forward to his death because it's an embalming item. And then the frankincense is indicative of his purity, his righteousness and rightness. Interesting. I don't know that's in the Bible. That's just kind of the how people treat it. So the way we do it is we do three gifts for basically something of value and then something for their mind and then something for their spiritual health. That's kind of how we do it. And so yeah, so one thing is like something they really like, like, oh, you finally got that pogo stick or whatever it might be, you know, and then you have other things. I don't know. It's a fun little thing. And so are you giving gifts to your kids in 1951? Yeah, exactly. After that, it was a hula hoop and then a poodle skirt. Dude, yeah. Dude, I got a pogo stick. Dude, I did get a pogo stick one year and it was amazing. I used to wait for the bus at the end of the driveway, trying to break the record for the number of hops on the pogo stick. It was amazing. I loved it. But yeah, so the Magi, I want to know more about who they are. I did watch your video, which I would encourage the third chair to do. So my understanding is these were people from the Far East that came. They saw this star. And the thing that you said in your video that was most interesting to me is they knew the sky to the point where they saw something so different or compelling or whatever. And it motivated them to action and not just like, Oh, wow, this is amazing. Like I'm going to go to my friend's house and look at this through a telescope. Like they knew a specific place that they were and they knew where to go. And in order to do that, that's just fascinating to me. Well, and they thought they should bring gold. Yeah. That part's pretty insane too. Yeah. So can you just kind of, I just want to hear you talk about this for just a few minutes and just, I just want to hear your thoughts on who were the Magi or the wise man, as I've heard it called. So yeah, just dump it on me. All right. Well, some people think that these were specifically religious practitioners within Zoroastrianism, which for as long as I've known that word and been familiar with that ancient religion continues to be a mouthful. Certainly that's like Northern. I've known some people that practice this. Yeah. Northern Iran, like well, Kurdistan would be correct. And some people for that reason believe that the Kurds are somehow descended from the same people group that are the Magi of Matthew chapter two of the Nativity story could be. Some people think that there were Western practitioners or further Western practitioners of the similar religion that would have hung out in Petra in modern day Jordan. Yeah, you're familiar with Petra, right? The stone carved city from Indiana Jones. Yeah. It could be that the it doesn't square neatly with the Matthew chapter two account because it wouldn't be that far of a trip. That would be relatively local for King Herod. They would have known who King Herod was. They wouldn't have had any reason to go back on a different route because it just wasn't that far away. Then it's not a stone's throw, but it's a day trip from Jerusalem today if you're traveling in the Holy Land. So I think they were from the Far East, the same term for Magi that we see used in Matthew chapter two also got used to talk about the Magi in early on in the book of Daniel. But those were two different languages, right? So Daniel would have been written in what language? Yeah, Daniel is a it's a goofy one because it's got the most linguistic variety of any of the Old Testament books that would exist in Hebrew. But there are also portions that are in Aramaic and there are there's also linguistic influence from the language of the Babylonians there. And so there's a couple passages in Daniel that seminary professors will say, like this is the hardest part of the entire Bible to translate. It's super cryptic and difficult. And so yeah, I mean, it was a mismatch of cultures there for a while. So it makes sense that it would be difficult to reconcile all of that language as neatly as we might be able to do with other parts of the Bible. But yeah, Daniel has several interactions with court magicians. And there are all of these extra biblical sources who are like, Oh, yeah, this magi thing. It's totally a deal. You got your low ranking, cheap, trick, sorcerer, magic people who do like illusions and things. That's different. They'll sell you a curse for a rival racehorse in the marketplace for 10 bucks. That's not what we're talking about here. The ancient historians also described this upper crust, fancy wielders of arcane secret, dark, even sometimes knowledge that this class of like what we would now liken to like the masons or the Knights Templar, almost like a secret society who operates in the shadows and has secret meetings and wears robes. And they know stuff that other people don't know. And they're the keepers of the flame and this ancient knowledge. And Aristotle is quoted as believing that this same magi tradition from the east, like in Persia in the hundreds of years leading up to the time of Christ, it's that it's the same intellectual tradition as what happened in ancient Egypt, even in the, the court, the, the pharaoh that you hear coming up in the book of Exodus. Oh, like, like during the, the plagues, that's always bothered me where, you know, the part about the snakes. Yeah, exactly. Turns the staff into a snake and then the court magicians are like, okay, boom, snake staff. I was like, wait a second. Yeah, but they're the most snakes eats their snakes. Yeah. It's bothered me to. What the heck is that about? And if that account is to be understood literally, then what that would mean for the person who practices Christianity or Judaism and believes that's an accurate description of reality is that that means then that there is within the boundaries of Christianity and Judaism, some force that is supernatural, that is less than God, but beyond the boundaries of what is holy, what is natural, what is good. There's, there's a dark force as well as what that means. And there's some sort of power attached to it. Now I know a naturalist worldview doesn't allow for any of that stuff. And I completely get that, but it always stuck in my craw as well. And so these magi are maybe like the most credible group of people that you could point to the best attested group of people outside of being neatly associated with one religion or one place that you could be like, if there's a wizard class in the far distant past, it's these people. And we see them overlapping with multiple religions. And it's like this group of people knew that something about planet Earth and something about nature and philosophy and reason and chemistry and maybe alchemy, that there was these nuggets of truth and all of these things. And they were trying to add it up to gain access to a knowledge that was beyond the natural. So it gets into some pretty goofy, fascinating Dungeons and Dragons game of Thrones fantasy world kind of stuff when you start talking about these characters. Dude, that's crazy. Okay. I'm with you. Keep going. So I think amongst all of the different competing explanations for who the magi were, I think they probably were a part of this class. And part of the reason I would reason to that is because you got to remember Matthew was a book that was written by someone to make a point. Matthew was writing to Jewish people and the point he's clearly trying to make, whether the reader agrees with the point or not, is Jesus is God in the flesh, the son of God. He came as a little baby to establish the kingdom of God and to be the culminating event in God's redemptive plan for fixing everything that is broken about the world. And if you're trying to make that case, that this guy is the Messiah, that he should be treated as the long promised long awaited king. And you can vouch for that. Well, you better choose carefully with who you point to as your vouchers. And I don't think that Matthew would go and pick some no names that everybody knew were a joke and a fraud and nobody had any respect for and then include that detail in the story. Like even if it happened, Matthew doesn't have to give us that detail. He chose to include the detail in his birth account of Jesus because he thought their presence would lend credibility to the claims of Jesus to Messiah's ship and to kingship and to being God in the flesh. So that causes me to believe that. I don't know that I agree that it was included because it would lend credibility because then you have at Jesus's resurrection, you have women showing up first to the tomb, right? And that, you know, a woman in that day and time wasn't wasn't a viable witness in a court testimony is my understanding. I don't know anything about ancient courts or anything, but that's what I've read. And so another possibility is that it could have just been true. It could have just happened and it's like, hey, I'm trying to write the account. And this is what happened and so I'll include it. Yeah. And I'm going to disagree with you back. Partly just to be stubborn, but partly because I actually disagree. Yeah. I think both events were true. I really agree with you there, but they're you still have to admit. I mean, it's a 28 chapter book, the book of Matthew. There's far more editorially left out than is included in the story of Jesus. What I'm saying is if the Magi didn't lend themselves to helping Matthew's argument, he just simply would have omitted it even though it was still true and it still happened. The fact that he included it tells me that he believed that the people he was trying to convince would think it was a good vouch that the Magi came. Now he's trying to accomplish something different at the resurrection. And there's a more robust vouch that comes from more people anyway in the resurrection. And he's trying to make more complex theological points about who this is for and the role they all played that I don't think we have time to unpack. So in both the cases, we're bringing it up here. You can see that Matthew is making editorial decisions to support the theological agenda that he has for what he's trying to communicate about Jesus and the Magi contributed something to the story in his mind. Got it. Okay. So that gives me a good idea who these people were. They were some kind of ancient class that had access to the Hebrew scriptures that knew something was going to go down in Bethlehem and if somebody was going to be born and that person was going to be significant, therefore they should go visit, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And I would take that one step further. The data that they had and that is now lost to you and me must have been so massive regarding the natural world. Then look, I mean, you agree with their conclusions. You think they should have made the trip, shouldn't have made them. Whatever your opinion is, they must have had so much clarity on what the normal rhythms of things were that the appearance of one celestial body that mind you, everybody else missed, we have no record of anybody else even catching it. So it wasn't that glaring, but that appearance of one celestial body was enough for them to put their reputation on the line at least a couple years worth of their lives on pause to go and make this trip. And they spent a crap ton of money and then donated it to some little kid. They were very, very sure of what they had. And what that tells me is they must have had a very robust data set for one anomaly like that that maybe wouldn't even catch the eye of you or me to initiate such action on their part. So there's this website, I forget the, it's like heavens above.net or something like that. I forget the exact URL. But for years, when I started doing astro photography, I started logging in, I was like, okay, what can I see tonight? And you can do a couple of things. You can see actual constellations, it'll show you a star map for that given night at your specific geolocation. But it'll also tell you the different satellites that are in orbit, both natural and man-made. And what's cool is it'll say, okay, this one will appear at this declination at this time on this, you know, this angle of the horizon. You'll be able to see it from here to here over the sky. But at this point, it'll fall behind the Earth's shadow and you won't be able to see it. So for three minutes, you'll see this from here to here and then it'll go away. And sure enough, you point the camera up, boom, you see it, you click the, you know, click the shutter and you get the star streak as it goes across. I've always found that to be incredibly fascinating. In order to understand a satellite, you have to have something called a state vector. And a state vector, I forget how many terms it has. I'm not the best at orbital mechanics. I think it has at least six terms. And if you, if you can figure out where something is and where it's going, then you can do all the math related to its orbit and you can figure out where it's going to be two weeks from now, ideally, you know, it kind of falls back to Earth and stuff like that. But there was this dude years ago that lived in Maryland and his hobby in the 50s was to say, okay, what launches have happened and what orbital inclination were these satellites inserted into and where are these things at? And so he literally had in this notebook when Sputnik was launched and he didn't just say, oh, Sputnik was launched on this day. He wrote, this is where it was launched from. This is the eccentricity of the orbit. This is the orbital inclination. This is the period, you know, all the different stuff. And he had all that information. And he did this as a hobby his entire life. And he started with thing in orbit, like 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 and his whole life. Yeah. Yeah. His whole life he kept up with this information. And one day, I'm down in the basement of the library, the Salman Library at UAH University of Alabama in Huntsville. And I'm looking at all this stuff. I'm like, hey, what's all this stuff? Mr. Librarian that nobody talks to in the basement. He's like, oh, this is the blah, blah, blah archives. I was like, I'm sorry, what? Oh, yeah, just open it. And I just, you know, how you kind of walk down the books and you have your finger on it. You just, you know, rubbing along the spines of the books and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. I'll just pick this one up. And I, you know, put my finger at the top and pull the book out and open it up. And I just flip over to a page and it says something like Atlas five, May 3rd, 1975 launched from Canaveral, you know, this orbital inclination that, you know, it just says all the things. And then I just look back at all the books, I just walked past and I was like, what? Are these full? And they were. And so that was this guy's hobby. And he had all of this data. And it occurred to me that the value of this information was unimaginable. We have the history of every satellite that was ever launched into orbit. Now, likewise, you could reestablish the night sky, including what man made things were in it at any given point, on any given day, at any given time with the data in those books. Yes. Assuming things didn't happen like anti-satellite missile tests between Russia, China, and America, all trying to out do each other and using justifications like, Oh, there's hydrazine on the satellite. It might land somewhere. We did that. Anyway, long story short, fascinating. You get it, your historian, you understand the both technical value of that and the historical value of that. I imagine these magi as having access to that type of information, but about just the natural heavenly bodies. And so as a comet would come around every 600 years that you and I don't even know the name of, they probably knew about it because their ancestors had written that down in some whatever they wrote things down on or even if it was an oral history. I think that's amazing. And so they think they had to know it. And if they hadn't known that, their data set wouldn't have been big enough to move the needle. If they only had 150 years worth of data, I don't think some star that they saw in the West from the East would have been enough to be like, Oh, yeah, we got to go. We got to spend money on this one. I think you're talking about thousands of years of information to justify that human behavior. Absolutely. And they had, we give Galileo the credit for the telescope. They had to have had something like that. They had to have had some type of instrument that they looked at the sky with. I just believe that to be true. I don't know that it is, but I believe it probably is. I just think it's amazing. And another thing they would have realized is, Oh, we've got these points of light that behave this way. They go along the ecliptic. They're in the sky, but we have these other points of light that sometimes don't obey the same rules as the other ones. And we would know those to be planets or, you know, maybe comments within our solar system, things of that nature, they would have quickly identified the points of light that behave differently and didn't as my daughter. I still think about this all the time. And a long time ago, we had this flower that didn't, it wouldn't hold the bloom from the stem at the bottom. It kind of attached to the top of the bloom. And when my daughter was like three, she's like, Hey, check out this flower. It doesn't follow the rules. And I think about that all the time. And so these magi would have known the points of light that didn't follow the rules. And whatever this was, it probably didn't follow the rules. Yeah, I think the same. Anyway, I'm sorry. I got excited. They're vindicated, according to the story, because that's the kind of thing where lots of people are going to think they see something. And what's the phenomenon called paradolia, the one where you see patterns, where there aren't patterns. And it's just because humans think in patterns and we assign meaning to things where there aren't meaning. We all I mean, we all fall victim to it. It's like those memes where everything looks like a face. Like, Oh, the mailbox looks like a face. That food package looks like a face that house looks like it's smiling at me. We see those patterns and we inflict them on things. We do that with vision. We do that just auditorially with what we hear. And surely, we can all admit that people do that with signs. It's what superstition is. We think we saw something we see a pattern three or four times. It correlates with something we like or don't like and we say, Oh, well, that's, that's an omen. Humans have seen those kinds of patterns forever, usually unreliably. But the question is whether it checks out. Is there any vindication at the end? And that's sort of the difference between quackery and having your brain get the best of you. And maybe there's actually something to it. And in this story, the magi from the east who don't even practice the same religion, there's some completely other thing. They're vindicated because they believe that star meant there's a great king that's been born. We need to follow the star to find out where this is at. And sure enough, they find what they believe to be that great king who was born. You did a really good job in your video talking about the conversation between these people and King Herod. You said, thank you. Yeah, can you just give me the Cliff Notes version? My favorite part about how you did is you acted as if you were King Herod. You know, you know what I'm talking about? You're like, Oh, a completely different king. This is wonderful news. What sitting King wouldn't be thrilled to hear that another king has been born in his territory. Yeah, that's what's funny about it is they go looking for a king. They follow this star where the kings live in the historical seat of power, the capital city of a region. At this point, Caesarea would have been the Roman capital, which is back on the Mediterranean Sea and days walk from Jerusalem, but they go to the historic capital of Jerusalem and they run into the ethnic king, the sort of client king of the Roman state. And it's Herod who nobody really likes. He was weird and erratic and especially violent. At that point in his life, he got more and more nuts and more and more bloody the closer to the end. Things became, and so these magi show up and he would have known them by reputation as well if our speculation is correct as to who these people were. And so he greets them and they're like, Hey, you know, we're we're here because we saw the sign in the sky about the baby. And their tone is almost like, you know, the one that's totally unmissable. And in between the lines, it's pretty easy to read Herod and everybody else being like, yeah, we know. I mean, my court astrologers obviously caught that too. Could you just say it out loud though? Because I want to hear if you know what it is for sure. And so, and so this motif of the clown king, which is a really fun thing about the Bible for people in the third chair who aren't religious and maybe haven't had the pleasure of going through the Bible. If you ever do, just because you want to know what the thing is about, keep your antenna out for the clown king motif. It's fun. It's funny. It comes up all over the text, Old Testament and New Testament. But the idea is all the people who are so important and have all the power over the people, they're all, they're all a joke. None of them are actually wearing any clothes. And of course, the theological punchline of that is only God is the clothed emperor, the one who actually has authority and merit to do all these things. And the only one who rightly judges. But it's really fun to see how it's stupid all the kings look along the way. And Herod just looks like a clown throughout this whole thing in Matthew chapter two. The Magi, the foreigners are the ones who know more about his own religion than he does. And so, Herod's like, yeah, hang on a minute. I need you guys to leave because I seem to talk about some stuff real quick with some friends. And he calls his advisors in. He's like, where's the Messiah? I think they're talking about the Messiah. We have that right in our religion. We have one of those. Where's he supposed to be born? Do we know that? And his religious guys are like, Oh, yeah, it's supposed to be born in Bethlehem. And then Herod calls the Magi back in and is like, OK, yeah. All right, I got that taken care of. So anyways, obviously, I'd like to go worship this king too. If you guys find him, that would be super helpful. I just swing by and maybe bring like a gift basket and definitely not any soldiers or anything. I just, I'd want to go see him. I'm not at all insecure threatened by the idea of this king being born. So just let me know. And then the Magi are like, OK, that sounds great. And they do find the baby and they are warned in a dream to go back by a different route. So they never check back in with Herod. They just ghost him. And then Harry gets super mad. And he's like, well, I just wanted to kill one baby to eliminate the threat. But now since I don't know which one is the problem, I'm going to have to kill all the babies there under the age of two. And that's the timeline under the age of two that causes us to do the math and be like, Oh, the Magi must have come a little bit later than Jesus' birth. They showed up when Jesus was maybe a toddler or something like that. So then famously, of course, Joseph is said to have been warned in a dream to get out of there. And so he takes the Holy family, probably uses money that he just got. I mean, the gold that he just got would have funded a trip to Egypt. And so then he goes to Egypt and he hides out there and a movement in the story that kind of rhymes narratively with the Jewish people's time in Egypt and the books of Genesis and mostly Exodus in the Old Testament. And then when Herod dies, they come back out of Egypt and they settle down in Nazareth and then you're off and into the rest of the New Testament. There's so much here, dude. Like, imagine you're Joseph, your wife who you didn't impregnate is having a baby. Yeah. The baby, like the chosen one, yeah. The Redeemer. And I mean, I, man, I want to sit and talk to Joseph. I really do. Also, the fact that the Magi showed up is what triggered a baby murdering spree. You know, you ever thought about that? I mean, that's, there's so much here. Yeah. And some people look at that and they're like, ah, Josephus, he's like the big historian of this era for this part of the world. Now, I got Josephus doesn't talk about that. And he's really critical of Herod. You know, there's no extra biblical record of Herod killing these babies in Bethlehem. Maybe he didn't do it. And it's absolutely a factually correct statement to say that at this time, we do not have external corroboration of that event. But another way to read the data is to be like, it was just such a normal Tuesday night for the last five or six years of Herod's reign, just arbitrarily and sanely murder some babies or I mean, Herod set it up so that he had a whole bunch of people who were going to murder like a thousand adult men on the day of his death because he knew nobody in Jerusalem or Judea would be sad when he died and he wanted there to be mourning. So he's going to have a whole bunch of people just arbitrarily randomly killed under his Kingly orders. And fortunately, the people who were ordered to do so were like, I don't think we're going to do that at all. So this guy was just maniacal and nuts. And it did not take much to set him into a very violent frenzy, even within his own family. So the behavior is very consistent here with what we see from Herod in other extra biblical accounts as well. We live in pretty good times. I mean, yeah, I don't know. I don't know. This was this is what I want to do here, Matt. And you told me in a previous phone call that this was Matthew chapter two after I watched your video. And so briefly, can you tell me the account of the the nativity story in the gospels? Matthew Mark Luke John and why we're going to read Matthew two here in a second? Sure. Yeah, Mark and John don't really give us much at all. And the reason for that is that Mark, the shortest of the four gospel accounts, those are the accounts that describe the life of Jesus in theological biography terms. Mark is it's an action movie. It's just go, go, go. So it opens with the life of Jesus cousin, John the Baptist, which we also get in Matthew. I mean, we get that. John the Baptist is in all of them. But Mark doesn't even give us the birth account. Peter was probably the brains behind Mark's account. Mark probably gleaned all of that from him. And Peter wasn't around for the birth. And Peter's not the kind of guy who would have gone and done the historical homework to be able to tell Mark. So Mark pretty much picks up where Peter would have joined the story. Therefore, no birth account there whatsoever. John is a much more philosophical book that's sort of emerging of Jewish philosophy and Greek philosophy. If somebody goes and reads John chapter one, they're going to see stuff that sounds like Plato, the ancient philosopher. They're going to hear stuff that sounds like Aristotle and his Plato's student. A bunch of stuff you might remember from freshman philosophy, like the cave illustration and the philosopher king. Those kind of nods are there. So John is talking philosophically about Jesus coming into the world as this light who could illuminate the darkness, but the darkness has trouble understanding it. And then it rolls right into the stuff about John the Baptist without any details about Jesus birth whatsoever. Then Luke, who is the consummate historian, he was a medical doctor trained academically. He was not an eyewitness to these things. But he opens his account saying, I've got it right here. I'm just going to read it to you. Is that okay? Are you all right with me reading Bible at you here? Yeah, do it. Okay. He opens up talking about his methodology. He says, many have undertaken a drop in account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. So he's saying he wasn't. Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you. Most excellent theophilus. There's debate about who he's writing to there so that you may know the certainty of those things you have been taught. So Luke is saying that he went and did the work himself, even though he was probably geographically an outsider, definitely ethnically an outsider. He picked up the Jesus thing along the way somewhere and had the mental capacity to do the academic work to tell the story. So he goes all the way back to the beginning. My guess is he probably sat and talked with Mary. It makes sense because in Luke's account, we get all the stuff you always get at Christmas Eve service and all of that about the announcement that this baby is going to be born. The angel shows up and Mary's like, I'm a virgin. How's that actually going to work? And the angel's like, this will be accomplished by the power of God, the Holy Spirit. And then Mary is like, all right, I don't get it. This is scary, but may it be unto me, as you have said, and then she goes and visits her cousin Elizabeth, according to Luke's account. And they compare notes because they're both having remarkable pregnancies. She's pregnant with John the Baptist. Mary is pregnant with Jesus. And then Mary gives this beautiful poem or song that historically we've called the Magnificat that again, like, man, even if you're not into Christianity or religion, this is just one of the most lovely compositions, beloved compositions in the history of humanity. And it was written by probably like a 14 or 15 year old girl in the backwaters of Judea or Galilee. And she produces just this incredible stuff that demonstrates this poetic understanding that provides order to like the whole story of history as she understood it to that point. And so I think Luke probably did talk to Mary and she told him about these events specifically. And that's the whole story about there being a census and everybody goes to their hometown and the baby is born and Bethlehem and chapter two. That's what we typically read, right? Like Luke, Luke is what everybody usually reads. It's the long account and you get the most details. And here, Luke is trying to make the gospel message. The story of Jesus makes sense to a very broad audience. He's not talking to Jewish people who already had a conception of this Messiah that was very robust. He's talking to Greek people in modern day Greece. He's talking to Romans on the Italian peninsula, North Africans. This thing is meant to be consumed by everybody. So he's trying to tell it in broad strokes that would sound like the notions of heroism and a very important backstory. Like everybody would have expected that from the kind of hero Luke is holding Jesus out as being. So the origin story is important, whereas for whom Mark and John are writing to, it's just not as big a deal. But Matthew is writing to Jewish people. And the thing he has to convince them of is that Jesus is the long promised son of David. That's what they were looking for. And I suppose most Jewish people today would say, oh, that's that's what we're still looking for. This is where we disagree with Christians. We agree on the Old Testament. You Christians think that Jesus was the Messiah and the fulfillment of the Old Testament. I think most Jewish people would say, we're still keeping an eye out for that Messiah. We don't think he's come yet. Well, Matthew, who met Jesus and hung out with Jesus, he thought that Jesus was the Messiah. So he opens with this long genealogy that just isn't fun to read at a Christmas Eve service. So we don't do it. But the genealogy has all the big rock star names from the past, like Abraham and David and all of that. And it's meant to demonstrate that Jesus is descended from this line humanly, but also from God supernaturally. So that's like the street cred, right? Yeah. It's like they all have a really good sense of what's going to play with their audience, all four of these different authors. And so none of them waste time on stuff that is going to have no cred to their audience. And all of them throw a ton of time at what will make sense to their audience. So yeah, yeah, you get it. That's where we pick up here in Matthew chapter two. So we just got through all the street cred in Matthew chapter one. We hear a little bit about Joseph and we hear a little bit about the birth. And then we pick up here to the visit of the wise men. Do you want to just read it? Should we just do that? Oh heck yeah. Yes, I thought you'd never ask. I like the Bible. I'm for that. I got the English standard version in front of me. What are you reading from? The one I have on my desk right now is a new international version 1984 translation. It just happens to be what I got. Okay, sounds good. How do you want to do it? Do you want to go first? You want to meet? So I got I'm looking at Matthew chapter two. I'm seeing 23 verses here. Which one would how about I start and then you pick up at seven. Does that work? Sure, let's do that. All right. You go through you go through seven. Take it away. My whole reason or desire to read this after watching your videos, I want to like get into the head of the the wise men. I also want to think about Herod and then I want to think about Joseph. This is a very, very short account. We're talking about just a few sentences, but there's so much here. All right. So here we go. Matthew chapter two, the visit of the wise men. Now, after Jesus was born and Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying, whereas he who has been born king of the Jews, for we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him. When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled in all Jerusalem with him and assembling all the chiefs and priests and scribes of the people. He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. And they told him, in Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet and you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd the people of Israel. Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, go make careful search for the child, but as soon as you find him report to me, so that I too may go and worship him. Well, after they heard the king, they went on their way and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. And when they saw the star, they were overjoyed. Now, coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. And so I'm picking up with 13 here. Now, when they had departed behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, rise, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him. And he rose and he took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remain there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet. Out of Egypt, I called my son. This is verse 16. When Herod realized that he'd been outwitted by the magi, he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity, who were two years old and under in accordance with the time he'd learned from the magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled. Quote, a voice is heard in Reimah weeping and great morning Rachel weeping for children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more unquote. After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel for those who were trying to take the child's life were dead. So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Arkelus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. By having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled. What was said through the prophets, he will be called a Nazarene. Does anything good come from Nazareth? Good babbling right there. Yeah. Well, I tell you what is significant there. Go ahead. I was just going to say I appreciated your video, man. And I enjoy talking about this stuff with you. So thank you very much for making me think deeper about this. Yeah, I really appreciate you saying that. Thanks for letting us do a little bit of Bible stuff on the podcast here. I think this is important and fascinating regardless of someone's precise convictions. But man, for somebody like me who thinks there's a deity behind this, it's even weightier and even more fun to get into. Yeah, dude, I'm convinced. I love it. So thanks for, yeah, thanks for, this is why I reached out to you in the very first phone call. I need you to explain this stuff well to me. I really appreciate it. So that's making crappy Bible videos on the internet. Yeah, it was nice of you to call. Thanks. That's been a good thing. I'm thankful for that this Christmas time. Yeah. Well, Merry Christmas, buddy. I really appreciate it. I appreciate the friendship. Thank you, third chair. Appreciate you too. Yeah, agreed. Merry Christmas, buddy. Thanks for doing this.
