        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.5" data-end="108.9"> So some years we kind of follow it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.9" data-end="112.54"> Some years we don't, but the three gifts, uh, in the Bible were gold,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="114.7" data-end="119.14"> And so we, we basically do it like this.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.5" data-end="124.22"> And so we'll give the kids something they really want.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.3" data-end="131.86"> This is like a spice or an herb or something like that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.86" data-end="133.70000000000002"> It's something it was used to prepare.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.22" data-end="136.38"> Well, what is frankincense?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.62" data-end="139.78"> No, I think myrrh was used for embalming.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.18" data-end="143.38"> I think frankincense was something that purified the air.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.38" data-end="148.66"> If you burned it, it made everything smell amazing and clean in a time in the</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.3" data-end="159.66"> Oh, yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.66" data-end="161.3"> All three of the gifts were super valuable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="162.22" data-end="167.9"> So yeah, the idea is that the gold is a gift you give a king and the myrrh.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="168.22" data-end="173.06"> And so that would be evocative of the biblical Christian theme of Jesus being a</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="182.70000000000002" data-end="188.06"> And then the frankincense is indicative of his purity, his righteousness and</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.06" data-end="188.62"> rightness.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.58" data-end="190.18"> Interesting.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.86" data-end="193.94"> That's just kind of the how people treat it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="194.5" data-end="199.62"> So the way we do it is we do three gifts for basically something of value and</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="199.62" data-end="204.7"> then something for their mind and then something for their spiritual health.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="205.7" data-end="209.94"> And so yeah, so one thing is like something they really like, like, oh,</p>
